//! Fuzz the rule-file parser.
//!
//! A root-owned rule file is attacker-adjacent in one specific way: an operator
//! pastes a snippet from somewhere. The parser must therefore never panic and
//! never accept something the validator would have rejected. Both are asserted
//! here, so a crash and a validation bypass are both findings.
