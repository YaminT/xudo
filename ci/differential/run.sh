# The differential compliance matrix: one static `xudo` binary and the shipped
# ruleset, driven inside real distributions against the real sudo, sudo-rs, and
# OpenDoas parsers, plus a container with no escalator at all.
#
#   ci/differential/run.sh <static linux xudo binary>      (or: just differential)
#
# xudod and xudo-gate are taken from the same directory as the xudo binary.
#
# Each row below names an image and how to install its backend. Inside the
# container, row.sh records three things:
#
#   report.txt    what is backend-specific and must match expected/<row>.txt
#                 exactly: which backend was found, every capability it was
#                 probed to have, whether the install plan is offered or refused,
#                 and whether the snippet xudo would write is accepted by that
#                 backend's own parser. Versions are normalized out, so a
#                 package update may not break this but a capability change
#                 must.
#   verdicts.txt  what is policy and must be identical in every row *and* match
#                 expected/verdicts.txt: the engine's answer for every argv in
#                 invocations.txt. No backend may change a verdict.
#
#   exec.txt      with a backend: the real broker and gate installed, `xudo exec`
#                 run as an unprivileged user through the backend on a pty with
#                 the password typed. Must be identical in every row and match
#                 expected/exec.txt. See exec.sh.
#
# Images are moving tags on purpose. Detection is runtime, and the point is to
# notice when a distribution's package changes what its backend can do.
#
# Bless a reviewed change with: cp target/differential.*/<row>/report.txt
# ci/differential/expected/<row>.txt (and likewise verdicts.txt), then commit
# the diff as the policy or backend change it is.
