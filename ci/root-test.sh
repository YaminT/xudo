# The tests that must run as root, run as root, on a real Linux kernel, from any
# host with Docker.
#
#   ci/root-test.sh [cargo test arguments]        (or: just root-test ...)
#
# The mirror of ci/linux-test.sh. The same hazards decide its shape, with the
# middle one turned around (docs/CONCERNS.md, 2026-10-14, 2026-10-15, and
# 2026-10-21):
#
# * Never on the bind mount. Docker Desktop's mount misreports the checkout as
#   root-owned to a root process, and intermittently reports a directory
#   created a moment earlier as missing. So the checkout is copied onto the
#   container's own filesystem first, and the mount is read-only.
# * Always as root, and only the tests that need it. ci/linux-test.sh refuses to
#   run as root because root ignores file modes, so every "a writable file is
#   refused" test passes vacuously. This lane exists for what only root can
#   observe: a file handed to root:root and moded 0440, a rename inside a
#   directory only root may write. The rest of the workspace is written for an
#   unprivileged user and assumes it (a checkout that is not root's, a mode that
#   refuses the caller), so it is not run here: as root it fails, or passes for
#   the wrong reason. What runs is every `tests/root_*.rs`, behind the
#   `root-tests` feature, and the script refuses to continue if it turns out
#   not to be root. A cargo feature selects the tests and nothing in a
#   privileged crate reads the environment to decide to run them.
# * Never with the checkout's own mtimes. Every checkout is copied to the same
#   /work and builds into the same target volume, and cargo decides freshness
#   by comparing mtimes. A worktree whose files are older than the last build
#   from a different worktree would be tested against that other worktree's
#   code, silently. So the copy is extracted with the current time on every
#   file, and every run rebuilds the workspace's own crates; the registry
#   crates, which are the slow part, stay cached.
#
# Root in a container is root in the container, and nothing here pretends
# otherwise: the tests may write anywhere in it. The checkout is mounted
# read-only and the copy is thrown away with the container, so what they write
# never leaves it.
#
# Two ways this lane could pass without proving anything are closed, because
# both are one careless edit away:
#
# * A root test that is not root returns early and says SKIPPED, so that the
#   suites that enable every feature (`just test`, `just linux-test`) can still
#   build and run them as an ordinary user. Here that is a failure: the output is
#   read, and any SKIPPED fails the run.
# * A lane that runs no tests is not a lane. The passing tests are counted from
#   cargo's own summaries, and none is a failure.
#
# Tests run one at a time, with their output shown: they change the container's
# real filesystem, which parallel tests would race, and the SKIPPED check above
# needs the output.
#
# The toolchain is the one rust-toolchain.toml pins. Registry and target caches
# are the named volumes ci/linux-test.sh uses, so a second run does not rebuild
# the world; the lock below keeps the two from using them at once.
