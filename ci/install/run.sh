# `xudo install` and `xudo install --uninstall`, run for real as root inside a
# container of its own, against real sudo, sudo-rs, and OpenDoas.
#
#   ci/install/run.sh <static linux xudo binary>          (or: just install-root)
#
# Why this is not part of `just linux-test`: that suite runs as an unprivileged
# user on purpose, because root ignores file modes and every "a writable file is
# refused" test would pass vacuously. The install writes under /etc as root, so
# it has to be exercised somewhere that really is root and really is disposable.
# Each row below is a fresh container, started here, thrown away after.
#
# What each row proves is in row.sh. In short: the install refuses anyone but
# root; it lays down exactly the file the plan names, 0440 or 0400 root:root,
# validated by the backend's own parser; it never replaces or removes a file it
# did not write; a backend that rejects the candidate leaves the old state as it
# was; and uninstall removes exactly what install wrote and nothing else.
#
# The one thing it does NOT prove is that the gate runs as root through the rule:
# `xudo install` cannot yet ask the broker for a request (M2b plan item C1), so
# its functional probe is missing. row.sh asserts the install says so, loudly,
# rather than claiming to have verified. The root lane (`just root-test`, job
# `root-tests`) proves that path with a hand-written request, for sudo. This
# harness overlaps it for sudo's install and uninstall and stays for sudo-rs and
# OpenDoas, which the root lane does not install.
