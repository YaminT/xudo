#   ci/linux-test.sh [cargo test arguments]        (or: just linux-test ...)
#
# Three hazards decide the shape, all found the hard way (docs/CONCERNS.md,
# 2026-10-14 and 2026-10-19):
#
# * Never on the bind mount. Docker Desktop's mount misreports the checkout as
#   root-owned to a root process, and intermittently reports a directory
#   created a moment earlier as missing. So the checkout is copied onto the
#   container's own filesystem first, and the mount is read-only.
# * Never as root. Root ignores file modes, so every "a writable file is
#   refused" test passes vacuously. The copy and the caches are prepared as
#   root, then the suite runs as an unprivileged user, and the script refuses to
#   continue if that user turns out to be root.
# * Never with the checkout's own mtimes. Every checkout is copied to the same
#   /work and builds into the same target volume, and cargo decides freshness
#   by comparing mtimes. A worktree whose files are older than the last build
#   from a different worktree would be tested against that other worktree's
#   code, silently. So the copy is extracted with the current time on every
#   file, and every run rebuilds the workspace's own crates; the registry
#   crates, which are the slow part, stay cached.
#
# The toolchain is the one rust-toolchain.toml pins. Registry and target caches
# live in named volumes so a second run does not rebuild the world.
