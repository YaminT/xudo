# ci/linux-test.sh and ci/root-test.sh both take this lock, at this path, so a
# run of one waits for a run of the other. They share the two cache volumes
# (xudo-linux-cargo and xudo-linux-target) and the Docker VM's memory, and
# parallel agents working in separate worktrees would otherwise race both: the
# target volume rebuilt from under each other, and enough concurrent rustc
# processes to get one killed with no message. The root run also leaves
# root-owned files in the volumes, which the next linux-test run takes back with
# a chown that must not race another run's compile.
#
# A directory is the lock because mkdir is atomic everywhere and macOS ships no
# flock(1); a lock whose holder has died is taken over. It is released when the
# shell that took it exits.
