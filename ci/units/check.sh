# systemd's own checks on every unit file under packaging/, inside a Debian
# trixie container, as root.
#
#   sh /harness/check.sh <exposure ceiling, in tenths>
#
# Expects the repository's packaging/ at /packaging and this directory at
# /harness, both read-only; ci/units/run.sh starts it. POSIX sh only. Two
# checks, each by systemd's own tool, and what each is for:
#
#   verify    `systemd-analyze verify`: the unit loads, what it names exists, and
#             systemd had nothing to say about any line of it. It must be
#             silent, not merely exit 0. For a misspelled directive or a value
#             it cannot parse it prints one warning, ignores the line, and exits
#             0 (measured on systemd 257.13), and a hardening line that is
#             ignored is a unit that starts without the protection. Applies to
#             every unit type.
#   exposure  `systemd-analyze security --offline`: systemd's own score for how
#             much a service's sandbox leaves open, held under a ceiling. It is
#             the net under crates/xudod/tests/units.rs, which asserts each line
#             by name and knows only the lines its author thought of. Applies to
#             services only: given a socket it scores everything a socket does
#             not declare, 9.6 UNSAFE, which means nothing.
#
# The programs the units run are not in the repository, so each absolute path a
# unit names is stubbed with an executable file before verify looks. That keeps
# a unit checkable on its own; it does not check that the package installs the
# program there, which is phase 3's test of the package.
#
# The lane also tests itself, because an exit status that looks like a verdict is
# the thing most worth distrusting here. See self_test.
