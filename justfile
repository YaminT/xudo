# --- coverage ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Four packages and one file are excluded, and every exclusion is load-bearing
# rather than convenient:
#
#   exec/host.rs is the only file that starts a child process. Its failure paths
#               need the kernel to fail a `fork` or a pipe read on a descriptor
#               we own, which a test cannot arrange. Every decision built on a
#               probe result sits behind the `Runner` trait and is fully covered
#               against a fake, so what is excluded is process plumbing only.
#   aido-bin    is the five-line entry point. Its own `tests/binary.rs` asserts
#               its exit statuses through a real process — 0, 17, and 19 — which
#               is the only place that behaviour exists. It is a correctness gate
#               (`just test` runs it), not a coverage source. Excluding one tiny
#               package is honest; a line-level waiver inside a shared file is
#               not.
#   aido-gate-bin is the same shape for the root executor: `main` collects argv,
#               hands `aido_gate::run` the real host, writes the one line it
#               returns, and exits with its status. Its `tests/binary.rs` runs
#               the real binary under each name a hardlink could give it, with
#               closed and leaked descriptors and a hostile argv, and asserts
#               the status and the line. The whole sequence, every refusal in
#               it, and every fake it runs against are in the `aido-gate` and
#               `aido-sys` libraries, at 100% like everything else.
#   ido-bin     is the same shape for `ido`, plus the raw terminal: reading the
#               environment once, termios raw mode, and the alternate screen.
#               None of that can run without a real terminal, so its
#               `tests/willyoumarryme.rs` drives it through real processes and a
#               real pseudo-terminal instead. The picker's logic is not here; it
#               is in the `ido` library, at 100% like everything else.
#   aidod-bin   is the same shape for the root broker: it borrows descriptor 0
#               from standard input, where systemd puts the accepted connection,
#               hands it and standard error to `aidod::run`, and exits with what
#               that returns. Its `tests/broker.rs` runs the real binary with a
#               real socket, a file, and nothing at all on descriptor 0. Every
#               decision is in the `aidod` library, at 100%.
#
# Everything else is 100% with no waivers. Do not add another exclusion without
# writing down why here.
