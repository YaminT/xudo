# todo — everything not yet built

Written 2026-08-26. Read this first; it is the index and the sequencing argument.

Design plan: `../design-plan.md`. Project rules: `../CLAUDE.md`. Enhancement backlog: `../SUGGESTIONS.md`.

## Where the project actually stands

> **Status, 2026-10-19.** M1 complete. M2 split: **M2a done**, M2b in progress (steps 0, 1, 2b, 4b, and 7 done: the Linux harness, the `aido-sys-raw` syscalls, strictest overlapping-rule enforcement, `doctor`'s report of the other paths to root with `--json` and `--fix`, and the refusal of a ruleset on a mount a non-root user could have made; the privileged execution path is not built). **Phase 5 part 1 done** (`aido-config`). **Phase 4 done** (`ido`, `ido-bin`, `term-sanitize`). The differential matrix runs in CI and trips the day an exec path appears. Next is **M2b**: Docker now gives a real Linux kernel to run privileged tests in, so the old "blocked on a VM" no longer holds for most of it. Read `../CONCERNS.md` first — it carries the decisions and what is still open.

**Done.** The crates in the table below, and a working unprivileged executable. A row that opens with **in review (M2b).** is a crate built in a lane's worktree and not yet a workspace member; merging it deletes the marker. `crates/aido-tests/tests/crate_inventory.rs` fails the build when this table and `Cargo.toml` disagree.

| Crate | What it is |
|---|---|
| `aido-policy` | The pure decision engine: typed per-position matchers with no globs anywhere, the compiled-in deny-list enumerated by capability class, the rule model and TOML loader, the versioned decision envelope with an append-only denial taxonomy |
| `aido-sys` | Syscalls behind traits, `/proc` parsers, ancestry walking, and the `MacOsStub` that forces every fail-closed branch on a non-Linux host |
| `aido-sys-raw` | The five system calls that cannot be made safely (`close_range`, `SO_PEERPIDFD`, `SO_PEERCRED`, `PIDFD_GET_INFO`, `execveat`) and the kernel-written records for two of them: the one crate that does not forbid `unsafe_code`, within a published block budget (M2b step 1) |
| `aido-backend` | The backend capability matrix, runtime detection, snippet generation, and the ordered install plan (M2a) |
| `aido-config` | Layered configuration: precedence, origin tracking, the narrowing-only project layer, and XDG path resolution (phase 5 part 1) |
| `aido-audit` | Tamper-evident audit records: builds them, chains them, verifies a chain, and decides where a writer picks a chain up and what journald receives; pure, with the file and the mirror in `aido-sys` (M2b step 6) |
| `aido` | The unprivileged front-end library |
| `aido-bin` | The five-line `aido` entry point, in its own package so the library is measured exactly once |
| `aido-wire` | **in review (M2b).** The wire protocol between `aido` and `aidod`: the messages and the parser for them (steps 2 and 3) |
| `aidod` | **in review (M2b).** The root broker: identifies its peer from kernel-attested facts, classifies it, decides with the engine `explain` uses, and mints bounded one-use requests (step 2) |
| `aidod-bin` | **in review (M2b).** The `aidod` executable, socket-activated on `/run/aido/broker.sock` (step 2) |
| `aido-gate` | The gate's decision core: the second, independent policy engine that re-decides from root-owned state, with spool-entry validation, the child environment, and the exit-status mapping; pure (M2b step 4, the decision half) |
| `aido-gate-bin` | **in review (M2b).** The gate executable, installed as `aido-gate` with `aido-gate-auth` as a hardlink (step 4) |
| `ido` | The buffered human-run command queue: queue file, derived status, picker state machine, runner, `AGENTS.md` splicer (phase 4) |
| `ido-bin` | The `ido` executable and its raw terminal, tested through real processes and a pseudo-terminal |
| `term-sanitize` | Display-only sanitizer for agent-written terminal text, shared by `ido` and the future `aido` prompt |
| `aido-tests` | Tests that belong to the workspace as a whole, starting with the check on this table; reserved for the executing half of the differential matrix, whose unprivileged half is `ci/differential/`, run by `just differential` (binary process tests live in `aido-bin/tests`) |

`aido explain`, `why-not`, `check`, `list`, `doctor`, and `agentdoc` all work. Four starter rule files ship and are tested as code.

**The gate:** 373 tests, 100% coverage on lines, regions, and functions with **zero line-level waivers**, zero clippy warnings, `cargo deny` clean, miri clean, three fuzz targets clean, a GTFOBins waiver gate, and a pre-commit hook. Nightly and `cargo-fuzz` are installed, so the fuzz and miri lanes have actually run — and fuzzing found a real bug on its first execution (see `../CONCERNS.md`).

**Not done.** The privileged execution path. The syscall primitives exist on main (`aido-sys-raw`, six audited `unsafe` blocks; the trust walk with its mount check; the audit sinks, not yet called by anything), but nothing this project builds can yet execute a command as root: the broker, the gate, `aido exec`, and the install executor are in review or unbuilt. `classify()` returns `Unattested` for every caller on every platform, so every request routes to the password path. The step-by-step plan to close M2b is `m2b-finish-plan.md`.

## Two numbering schemes, one project

The design plan numbers **milestones M1–M7** (technical layers). The user numbers **phases** (delivery stages): phase 1 was planning, phase 2 was the first development pass, and phases 3–5 are specified in the sibling files here. They are different axes and both are kept.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `phase-3-packaging-and-publish.md` | Debian/Ubuntu `.deb`, apt repository, one-line install, GitHub publication, SEO and AI-crawler discoverability, security disclosures, beta labelling |
| `phase-4-ido.md` | `ido` — the buffered human-run command queue, its TUI, `AGENTS.md` integration, and the `willyoumarryme` acceptance test |
| `phase-5-configuration.md` | Configuration layering and precedence for every binary, plus shipped predefined profiles |
| `m2b-finish-plan.md` | The exit test for M2b and the step-by-step sequence to reach it (written 2026-10-21) |

Milestones M1(remainder)–M7 are listed below rather than in separate files, because each is already specified in the design plan; what follows is the delta and the ordering.

---

## Remaining milestone work

### M1 remainder — make it runnable

Nothing here needs Linux or privilege, so it all runs on the macOS dev host.

- ~~**`crates/aido-sys`**~~ **DONE.** `PrivilegedOps` with `LinuxOps` and `MacOsStub`, procfs parsing from fixture trees, the attestation ladder, the backend probe, and now the descriptor-verified ruleset walk. No `unsafe` yet; `raw` arrives with M2b.
- ~~**`crates/aido` front-end**~~ **DONE, with three gaps:** `explain`, `why-not`, `check`, `list`, `doctor`, `config`, `install --dry-run`, `audit`, `agentdoc` exist. Not built: `check --fuzz` and `rule list|test` (the `[[test]]` blocks of SUGGESTIONS #10), both M6. `doctor --json` landed with M2b 4b, because verification item 1 needs it.
- ~~**Exit-code taxonomy wired to a real process exit**~~ **DONE.** `aido-bin/tests/binary.rs` asserts 0, 17, 18, and 19 through a real process.
- ~~**Install nightly + `cargo-fuzz`**~~ **DONE.** Three targets run on every push and for thirty minutes nightly.

Exit criterion: `aido explain -- apt-get install ripgrep` prints a matched rule with `file:line`; `aido explain -- /bin/sh -c id` prints a deny naming the capability class; `aido check` exits 0 on the shipped ruleset. Still executes nothing.

### M2 — human path end to end

**Split, because half of it cannot run on the dev host.** See `../CONCERNS.md` § "M2 cannot be finished or verified on this machine".

**M2a — done.** `crates/aido-backend`: the capability matrix, runtime backend detection, sudoers and doas snippet generation, and the ordered install/uninstall plan. All pure, all 100% covered. `aido doctor` now reports the backend, and correctly reports it as *unusable* on a host where a required directive cannot be confirmed.

**M2b — in progress.** The first slice landed 2026-10-14: the ruleset is read through verified descriptors (`aido_sys::read_trusted_dir`), and `aido doctor` reports through it. What is left, in the order to build it:

0. ~~**A Linux test harness, before any syscall code.**~~ **DONE 2026-10-15.** `just linux-test [cargo test args]`, in `ci/linux-test.sh`: the workspace copied into a Docker container and the suite run there as a non-root user. Not on the bind mount, which misreports the checkout as root-owned and intermittently loses a directory created a moment earlier; and not as root, under which file modes are not enforced and every refusal test passes vacuously. Containers give a real kernel for everything in M2b and M3. A VM is needed only for the kernel-version matrix and for M4's systemd scopes.
1. ~~**`aido-sys::raw`**~~ **DONE 2026-10-19, as the crate `aido-sys-raw`.** `close_range` (CLOEXEC-only), `SO_PEERPIDFD`, `PIDFD_GET_INFO`, and `execveat`, in five blocks (six, with `SO_PEERCRED` added the same day), behind `aido_sys::Syscalls` with `HostSyscalls` and a scripted `FakeSyscalls`. A crate rather than a module so that `aido-sys` keeps `forbid(unsafe_code)` and the compiler, not a scan, confines the unsafe code; `aido-sys-raw/tests/unsafe_budget.rs` is the backstop. Open for step 4: the gate's process model (exec in place, or fork and wait, which needs `fork` in the budget) and what it does on a pre-5.11 kernel where `CLOSE_RANGE_CLOEXEC` is refused. `SO_PEERCRED` now has its seam, `Syscalls::peer_cred`; open for step 2: `pidfd_open` and the liveness check need one of their own. See `../CONCERNS.md`.
2. **A minimal `aidod`, pulled forward from M3.** The gate as built refuses with `NoPendingRequest` unless a root-minted entry exists under `/run/aido/req`, and only a root daemon can mint one, so the human path cannot work without a broker. M2b's `aidod` does exactly this: accept a connection on `/run/aido/broker.sock` (systemd socket activation), identify the peer by the attestation ladder in `kernel.rs`, classify it `Unattested` (no cgroup lookup until M4), evaluate, mint the entry, return the nonce. No confirmation channel, no `freeze`, no cgroup classification. Load the rules with `aido_sys::load_trusted_rules` and mint with its `generation.id()`: the gate will compute the same value from the same bytes, through the same `aido_policy::load_rule_files` the front-end uses. `/run/aido` is `0755` with the socket `0660 root:aido` and `req/` `0700`, as the design plan's file table now says.
2b. ~~**Overlapping rules resolve to the strictest, and `check` says when they overlap.**~~ **DONE 2026-10-19.** Every action that accepts a command — the same program byte for byte, an argument list that accepts the canonical operands — now contributes its requirement: any human-only one refuses an agent, and the confirmation is the strictest any of them demands (critical tier, then `confirm = "always"`, then the agent setting). That holds in `aido_policy::evaluate`, so a caller naming a permissive duplicate gains nothing and the gate inherits it, and in the new `aido_policy::evaluate_command`, which replaces the front-end's `best_match` so the broker and `aido exec` search the ruleset through the engine rather than beside it. A decision cites the action whose requirement it carries; a tie cites the action asked for, or the first declared. `RuleSet::overlaps` reports every pair of actions that can accept one command — decided exactly for literal, enumeration, range, path, and name positions, reported as *possible* where a pattern or a search too large to finish leaves it open, never silent — and `aido check` prints it, each certain overlap with a command the engine accepts under both. The shipped rules are disjoint and `tests/shipped_rules.rs` keeps them so. Standing property: adding a rule never removes a confirmation, and rule order never changes one. No last-match-wins, no negation. See `../CONCERNS.md`.
3. **`aido exec -- <argv>`** in the front-end: the same matching as `explain`, then the broker round-trip, then exec of `sudo /usr/libexec/aido/aido-gate-auth` (or `doas`), with the backend's exit status passed through. A denial whose remediation is "a human must run this" prints the exact `ido queue` line to run instead. That is phase 4 § 8, first half; the second half (`ido` running an entry through `aido exec`) is M6.
4. **`aido-gate-bin`**: the executable, in its own package like `aido-bin`, installed as `/usr/libexec/aido/aido-gate` with `aido-gate-auth` as a hardlink; `aido-gate-nopass` is not shipped until M4. `close_range` first, `/dev/null` substitution for closed standard descriptors, the `statfs` check on `/proc`, the lineage walk gate → sudo/doas → `aido` pinned by `(pid, starttime)`, the ruleset through `read_trusted_dir`, `O_PATH` + `fstat` + digest pin, `execveat(fd, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH)`, the environment from `aido_gate::child_environment`, `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, faithful exit-status and signal propagation.
4b. ~~**`aido doctor --json`, `--fix`, and the every-other-path-to-root report**~~ **DONE 2026-10-19.** `aido_backend::paths_to_root` is the report, pure, behind a `HostView` trait with `MemoryHost` as its fake; `aido_sys::LiveHost` answers it on a real machine, unprivileged. Six checks: passwordless rules in sudoers (includes followed, `/etc/sudoers.d` read even when `/etc/sudoers` cannot be) and doas, membership of nine groups that are root by another name, writable unit and generator directories, root's `PATH`, your `PATH` ahead of the backend, and the files root's shells read; "writable" judged on every directory the kernel passes through, links followed one at a time. What it cannot read is unverified, never clean. `doctor --json` is a versioned envelope (`schema_version` 1) with the backend, its implementation, every probed capability even for a refused backend, the kernel's attestation rung, the ruleset's trust walk, and the report, pinned by snapshots. `--fix` prints each proposal, what it means, and the exact command, and applies nothing: see `../CONCERNS.md` for why. `SECURITY.md` says what it reports and what it cannot see. An independent review found fifteen defects in it (a link at the front of `PATH` disabling the user-`PATH` check, sudoers continuation and comments lexed differently from sudo so that a real `!authenticate` read clean, and thirteen more), each fixed with a test; four further rounds, run against sudo 1.9.16p2 and OpenDoas 6.8.2, each found the readers joining lines where the real lexers do not. The fifth decision stops modelling continuations: every physical line ending in a backslash, whatever precedes it, in both dialects, makes what it may join "maybe" (never "no") and the file unverified, so the check is never clean (found where a rule is found, unverified where none is); a tag split across the join still counts and an include on any joined line is still followed by both of its paths, the one with its trailing backslash kept, which is the file sudo opens, and the one with it cut off, and the cost is that a file with a continuation line reads "maybe" and unverified instead of certain. The real fix for the class is item D3 in `m2b-finish-plan.md`: ask the program itself, `doas -C` unprivileged and `sudo -l -U` as root, and keep the hand reader as a hint. Details, and the evidence against the real programs: `../CONCERNS.md`.
5. **Executing the install plan**: `aido install` without `--dry-run`. `visudo -cf` on the candidate, inode check, atomic rename, and the functional post-install probe the plan already describes.
6. ~~**Audit sinks**~~ **DONE 2026-10-19.** `aido-sys::audit`: the contract both privileged binaries write through, and the two sinks, not yet wired to either. `AuditSink::append` builds each record from the chain's last record while the log is locked and returns an `AuditReceipt` only a sink can make; `authorize` hands an approval back as `Authorized<T>` only with that receipt, for a record carrying the approval's command and governing action, and drops it otherwise; the broker's mint and the gate's exec, by taking an `Authorized<_>`, are what will keep an unrecorded approval from being acted on. `JsonlLog` is the chain's authority at `/var/lib/aido/audit.jsonl` (not `/var/log`, which is `root:syslog 0775` on Ubuntu): directory by the descriptor walk, file `O_APPEND|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC|O_CREAT` at `0600`, refused unless root's, private, and singly linked, an exclusive `flock` with a bounded wait and the file re-checked once it is held, the tail read from the end, `fdatasync` (plus a directory `fsync` for the first record) and the journald send under the lock before the receipt, any failure from the write on cut back, and a log ending in damage refused rather than continued or restarted, damage `aido audit --log` reports too. `JournaldSink` mirrors each record as one native-protocol datagram through rustix's safe socket API, `AIDO_RECORD` carrying the file line byte for byte, and fails closed where there is no journald; only entries with `_UID=0` count (`aido_audit::journal::query`). `AuditTrail::system` is both; `FakeAuditSink` sits behind a `fake` feature only test builds enable. Decisions and what is open: `../CONCERNS.md`, 2026-10-19.
7. ~~**The one trust check still missing**: a ruleset on a filesystem mounted by a non-root user.~~ **DONE 2026-10-19.** `open_trusted`, `read_trusted_dir`, and `load_trusted_rules` now match every descriptor they open — each component and each rule file — to its mount by the `mnt_id` in `/proc/thread-self/fdinfo/<fd>`, and judge that mount in `/proc/thread-self/mountinfo`, both read only through descriptors `fstatfs` proves are on procfs. Refused to every reader: a FUSE mount (`fuse`, `fuseblk`, `fuse.*`) unless it names exactly one `user_id` and that is `0`; an `idmapped` mount; a mount the table does not list; a table that cannot be read or does not parse, now refused whole on any malformed line; and everything when the thread is outside the initial user namespace. The two ruleset readers also refuse `nosuid` and `noexec`; `open_trusted` does not, because systemd mounts `/run`, the gate's spool, `nosuid`. Each component is opened `O_PATH`, which asks its filesystem nothing, and its mount is judged before its owner and mode are read and before anything beneath it is looked up, so a user's FUSE daemon is never consulted; what is read is reopened and refused unless it is the inode that passed. A directory's mount is judged before it is listed, and every rule file's before any is read. Matched by mount id, not by `st_dev` as first proposed, because on btrfs no file's `st_dev` appears in mountinfo at all (measured). `aido doctor` names the component, the filesystem, its mount point, and the reason, with the mount's bytes escaped: a FUSE daemon names its own subtype. Off Linux there is no mount table, so the three refuse everything there. See `../CONCERNS.md`.
8. **The executing half of the differential matrix**, in `aido-tests`: the same ruleset run *through* sudo, sudo-rs, and OpenDoas with identical outcomes. `ci/differential/row.sh` fails the build demanding it the moment `doctor` stops reporting the exec path as absent.

Where the password lives, per `howiwork.md` (2026-10-19): an **approved** request from an attested agent takes the `NOPASSWD` hardlink and needs no human password (M4); a **Run with ido** entry, or a human running `aido` directly, takes the `PASSWD` hardlink and is prompted once. The `sudo`/`doas` hop is kept for the uid transition only, because aido ships no setuid bit; it is not the password mechanism. M2b builds the `PASSWD` side of that split, and the beta ships only that side.

One decision, recorded here because the gate's code depends on it: **on the password path, the password is the confirmation.** A rule with `confirm = "always"` yields `allow_with_confirmation`. On the agent path that goes to the out-of-band channel (M3). On the human path it is satisfied by sudo's PAM conversation on the fresh pty, a channel the requesting process tree cannot answer without the secret. The gate knows which path it is on from `argv[0]`: `aido-gate-auth` means a password was typed, so `aido_gate::demanded_confirmation` bites on the `-nopass` name only.


### M3 — out-of-band confirmation

Still no passwordless path: every outcome still goes through the `PASSWD` hardlink. The broker and its one-use nonce records arrive with M2b; this milestone adds the confirmation state machine to it, which is what will later let an approved agent request need no password at all. The namespace-divergence guard. The channel layer: `aido watch`, the ownership-verified session TTY, `aido approve|deny|pending`, and **DENY when no channel is live**. Prompt integrity: every agent-written string through `term-sanitize` (built, shared with `ido`), typed-token responses, a human reaction-time floor, request de-duplication with exponential backoff. Absolute monotonic deadlines; timeout → deny, with the front-end receiving a structured pending-then-denied envelope rather than a hang. `aido freeze`/`thaw`.

Confirmation is purely additive here — every path still needs a password — so this ships as a safety upgrade with no new authentication surface, and it proves the hardest architectural claim before anything depends on it.

### M4 — agent enrollment and the passwordless path

The milestone the product exists for, deliberately last among the load-bearing ones. `aido-session` through the password path: root-owned transient cgroup scope under `aido.slice`, TTY capture and ownership validation, scope-bound HMAC token with a replay ledger and per-agent revocation, socketpair fd as proof of lineage, registry-pinned harness exec with a scrubbed environment. `aido agent add|list|remove` with `(st_dev, st_ino)` pinning and the mandatory printed disclaimer that the registry is an availability control. Broker classification by cgroup identity, activation of the `aido-gate-nopass` hardlink (the `NOPASSWD` rule attaches to that name and only that name), `confirm_agent_actions` defaulting true, non-delegable one-use grants. **This is the milestone where "approved means no human password" becomes true**: an attested agent's approved request runs through the `NOPASSWD` hop; a human, or any unattested caller, keeps the `PASSWD` hop (invariant 2). `SECURITY.md` published.

### M5 — narrowing, bounded grants, volume controls

`trust.d` records over (agent × project × action class) with mandatory reason and expiry; `--unattended` as a non-persistable per-invocation flag; a banner and a high-severity audit record on every use. Time-boxed grants with counters persisted before exec. Token buckets escalating annotate → force confirmation even under a grant → deny and notify, plus a separate rule-novelty bucket.

### M6 — ergonomics, profiles, harness integration

The verb surface (`aido pkg|svc|net|hosts|sysctl|time|dir|mount`), dry-run previews rendered into the confirmation prompt, `aido init`, `aido mcp`, EPERM shell hints, audit query with session replay, `check --fuzz`, `rule list|test`, and `ido` running a queued entry through `aido exec` (phase 4 § 8, second half). The `AGENTS.md` block becomes v2 and gains one line: *never run `ido run` or `ido drop`*. An agent that runs them gains nothing it could not do by running the command itself — `ido` holds no privilege, and a queued `sudo` has no terminal to prompt on — but the block should say so rather than rely on it.

### Verification checklist, against `../design-plan.md` § Verification

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | Everything listed | Done; `just verify` is the gate |
| 1 | `doctor --json` with backend, implementation, capabilities, other paths to root | Done 2026-10-19 (M2b 4b), pinned by snapshots; unverified where an unprivileged run cannot read |
| 2 | Human path prompts, under `rexpect` on a real pty | M2b |
| 3 | Snippet functionally in effect; dotted-filename regression | M2b 5 |
| 4 | Hostile direct gate invocation does nothing privileged | Decision core tested (`aido-gate`); binary M2b 4 |
| 5 | Nonce is one-use | Validation tested; consumption needs the broker (M2b 2) |
| 6–10 | Enrolled agent path, yolo, self-approval, timeout, cgroup spoofing | M3 and M4 |
| 11 | Env scrubbing with real payloads in the child's `/proc/self/environ` | Allowlist built and tested in `aido-gate::env`; child assertion M2b 4 |
| 12 | Symlink and TOCTOU resistance on ruleset, exec target, audit log | Ruleset done 2026-10-14; audit log done 2026-10-19 (sink built, not yet wired); exec target M2b 4 |
| 13 | Deny-list non-overridable; `check` refuses a rule naming a shell | Done |
| 14 | Differential compliance | Unprivileged half done and in CI; executing half M2b 8 |
| 15 | Audit chain verifies and detects truncation | Chain and sinks done; end-to-end (broker + gate writing, verify then truncate) is M2b closeout, see `m2b-finish-plan.md` D1 |
| 16 | `freeze` / `thaw` | Engine honours `frozen`; the commands are M3 |

### M7 — confinement, supply chain, external audit

Differential compliance matrix across sudo / sudo-rs / OpenDoas × distro × arch × kernel. Landlock and capability bounding per rule. Two-phase policy installs with semantic capability diffs. Signed rule bundles. Provably telemetry-free build. Then an external security audit.

---

## Recommended sequence

Strict numerical order is the wrong order. Two changes are worth making deliberately.

```
1. M1 remainder        DONE — aido-sys + the explain CLI. Makes it runnable.
2. M2a                 DONE — backend model, snippets, install plan. No syscalls.
3. Phase 5 (part 1)    DONE — aido-config: precedence, origins, narrowing-only
                       project layer, XDG paths, `aido config [--schema]`.
4. Phase 4             DONE 2026-10-14 — ido: queue, picker, runner, `ido add`,
                       the willyoumarryme acceptance test, man pages.
5. M2b                 STARTED 2026-10-14 — the ruleset is read through verified
                       descriptors; `just linux-test` runs the suite on Linux.
                       Left, in order: aido-sys::raw, a minimal aidod (minting only), `aido exec`,
                       aido-gate-bin, executing the install plan, the audit
                       sinks, the executing half of the differential matrix.
6. Phase 3             beta .deb + publish, human path only, no NOPASSWD shipped.
                       Ships aidod too: without the nopass hardlink it grants
                       nothing a password did not.
7. M3                  out-of-band confirmation on the broker from M2b.
8. M4                  enrollment + the passwordless path.
9. M5, M6              narrowing, grants, verbs, harness integration.
10. Phase 5 (part 2)   predefined profiles, config introspection.
11. M7                 confinement, signing, external audit.
```

M2b moved down the list on purpose: writing syscall code that has never executed
is the one thing most likely to produce a root exploit in this project, and
`cargo check --target` is not evidence it works. That is why the Linux test
harness is M2b's step 0 and not an afterthought. The reasoning is in
`../CONCERNS.md`.

**Config layering moved earlier, and is now done.** The reasoning below is kept because it is why:

**Why config layering moves earlier.** Precedence is the thing that is painful to retrofit: once three binaries each read config their own way, unifying them is a rewrite. The *foundation* (layer order, `deny_unknown_fields`, which keys are env-settable) should land with M2 while there are only two consumers. The *profiles* half genuinely belongs late, once there are enough rules to bundle.

**Why `ido` moves before the passwordless path.** `ido` needs no root, no cgroups, no broker, and no policy engine. It delivers the entire "the agent cannot run this, so a human runs it" story with none of M4's risk, and it makes the product useful to someone who would never enable a `NOPASSWD` rule. It is also the natural landing place for `aido`'s `HumanPathOnly` and `NoConfirmationChannel` denials — see phase 4.

**Why phase 3 ships before M3/M4.** The earliest defensible publication point is right after M2, when the tool is a hardened always-prompting sudo front-end. The beta `.deb` must **not** install the `NOPASSWD` hardlink or its sudoers rule at all; that arrives with M4 behind an explicit opt-in. Publishing a passwordless-root mechanism before an external audit, with no reviewed enrollment path, would be indefensible.

## Open decisions needing an answer before implementation

1. ~~**`ido add` is specified twice.**~~ **DECIDED:** `ido add` writes
   `AGENTS.md`, `ido queue` buffers. Original text: The phase 4 brief uses `ido add` both for "add these instructions to AGENTS.md" and, implicitly, for "add a command to the buffer". One has to move. Recommendation and reasoning in `phase-4-ido.md` § Command surface.
2. ~~**Where the queue file lives**~~ **DECIDED:** `$XDG_STATE_HOME`, as
   implemented. Original text: — `$XDG_STATE_HOME` (survives reboot, the useful behaviour) versus `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (a real temp file, cleared on logout, matches the word "temp" in the brief). Recommendation: state, with a documented retention cap.
3. ~~**Whether phase 3 publishes a real signed apt repository**~~ **DECIDED:**
   signed `.deb` on Releases, no apt repo yet. Original text: or only signed `.deb` artifacts on GitHub Releases. The one-line install reads very differently in each case.
4. ~~**Whether `ido` and `aido` are one package or two.**~~ **DECIDED:** one
   package; `ido` is not separately installable. Original text: They share the audit and config crates but have completely different privilege stories, and `ido` is installable by someone who does not want `aido` at all.
5. **DECIDED 2026-10-14: the broker's minting half is M2b, not M3.** The gate acts only on a root-minted request, so a human path with no broker is a human path that cannot execute. M3 keeps the confirmation channels, `freeze`, and the namespace guard.
6. **DECIDED 2026-10-14, restated 2026-10-19: on the password path, the password is the confirmation.** `confirm = "always"` reaches the out-of-band channel only on the passwordless path. The password itself lives next to `ido` and direct human runs, never on an approved agent request; the `sudo`/`doas` hop is the uid transition, kept because aido has no setuid bit. See M2b above and `howiwork.md` mismatch 5.
7. **DECIDED 2026-10-14: the gate executable is `aido-gate-bin`**, the same shape as `aido-bin` and `ido-bin`, so the pure `aido-gate` library stays measured at 100% and the binary is tested through real processes.
8. **DECIDED 2026-10-14: Linux tests run in Docker, as a non-root user, on a copy of the checkout.** A VM is for the kernel-version matrix and for M4's systemd scopes only. The old "blocked on a VM" was true of the machine, not of the work.
9. **DECIDED 2026-10-14, amended 2026-10-19: the `aido-sys-raw` crate holds the five syscalls that need `unsafe`** — `execveat`, `close_range`, `SO_PEERPIDFD`, `SO_PEERCRED`, `PIDFD_GET_INFO` — because rustix 1.1 wraps the rest of what the gate and broker are known to need without `unsafe`, and decodes `SO_PEERCRED` unsoundly (budget 6, decided 2026-10-19; see `../CONCERNS.md`). Two foreseeable additions are not in it: `fork`, if the gate outlives the command it runs, and a per-descriptor `fcntl` fallback below 5.11. Each is a budget change decided with the gate.
