# M2b — the plan to finish it

Written 2026-10-21 after a Fable review of the milestone against main at
`829f41d`. Supersedes nothing: `README.md` in this directory stays the index
and the step definitions; this file is the *sequence and exit test* for what is
left. When the two disagree, fix this one, it is newer.

## Where main stands (`829f41d`, CI green)

| Merged | Not merged, in a worktree | Not started |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Linux harness · 1 `xudo-sys-raw` · 2b strictest rules · 6 audit sinks (unwired) · 7 mount trust · `SO_PEERCRED` safe decode (sixth `unsafe` block) · `howiwork.md` and its derived views | 2 broker (review fixes applied, awaiting the decode switch) · 4b doctor (round 5: any line continuation → unverified) · 4 gate executor (built, awaiting its observer) · 5 install executor (mid-build) | 3 `xudo exec` · 8 executing differential · audit integration (D1) |

## How work moves

Every step runs through boof-runner, one chain per task: the planner (Opus)
writes the plan, **Sonnet develops, Opus observes, Fable reviews.** The
observer sends the developer back for fix rounds, a bounded number of them,
until it approves; only then does the Fable review run. Each verdict gates the
next step, and a missing or non-`APPROVE` verdict stops the task: the gate fails
closed. Review findings are reproduced before they are fixed, and every fix
lands with a test named for the attack it closes.

Each lane has a data root, `~/.boof/xudo/<lane>`, holding the durable task
records. Today boof creates the task worktrees under `.boof-runner-worktrees/`
in the main checkout, which `.gitignore` ignores and `.taplo.toml` excludes;
they will move outside the checkout once boof supports a configurable worktree
root. A task's branch is kept as `boof-runner/<task-id>`; a failed task keeps its
branch and worktree so a retry resumes from them.

After the final `APPROVE`, boof runs `ci/boof-integrate.sh` (the main
checkout's copy; the one in the worktree refuses to run). It guarantees, in
order: a clean worktree on the task branch; Conventional Commit subjects of at
most 50 characters; every Actions run on origin/main's head green; a rebase
onto origin/main; `just verify` and `just linux-test` on the rebased head; a
push without force, at most 3 attempts if main moves; every Actions run on the
pushed commit watched to completion; the main checkout fast-forwarded. Exit 0
marks the task done. `ci/boof-integrate-test.sh` proves each refusal. A change
to `justfile`, `ci/`, `.github/` or the other gate files is printed as a
`GATE FILES CHANGED` block in the task log, a warning for the reviewers, not a
refusal; a rename lists both the old and the new path, and the match ignores
case. A `gh` error while waiting for CI is retried with backoff and is never
read as a red or an absent run; when CI cannot be confirmed the hook says "not
confirmed" instead. A red main refuses the hook; a fix-forward task runs from a dedicated
hotfix data root whose hook argv adds `--allow-red-main`, which skips only that
check.

## What "M2b done" means

The review's reading of `design-plan.md` § M2 and the verification table, which
this file adopts as the exit test. All of these true, with Linux evidence:

1. Rules and the spool are loaded only through the trust walk, mount check
   included. *(done)*
2. A socket-activated root broker identifies its peer by the kernel, classifies,
   decides with the same engine `explain` uses, and mints bounded one-use
   requests. *(B1)*
3. `xudo exec` makes the broker round-trip, execs the backend's `PASSWD` hop,
   and passes the backend's exit status through; a human is prompted on a real
   pty. *(C1, verification row 2)*
4. The auth-only gate re-decides from root-owned state, consumes the nonce
   before anything runs, execs the validated descriptor with the hardening list,
   and propagates status and signals faithfully. *(B3)*
5. The doctor reports the backend, capabilities, trust, and every other path to
   root it can check, never printing clean for what it could not read. *(B2)*
6. Install writes a validated snippet atomically and a **functional** probe
   proves the gate executed as root; the dotted-filename regression is tested.
   *(B4, row 3)* **Status 2026-10-22:** the executor, the snippet, and the
   regression are done and tested as real root; the gate-as-uid-0 proof exists in
   the root lane (`xudo-gate-bin/tests/root_probe.rs`, a hand-written request
   through real `sudo`). **Done 2026-10-29:** `xudo install`'s own probe asks the
   broker for `id -u` (shipped rule `rules/05-probe.toml`), runs the gate as a
   child, and verifies only on `0`; the root lane proves it with the real
   broker and `xudo exec` on a pty. The doctor reporting a dotted name as not in
   effect is B2's.
7. The broker and the gate each write their own audit record through the
   step-6 contract; a sink that cannot be written prevents mint and execution;
   `xudo audit` verifies the produced trail and fails after truncation. *(D1,
   row 15)*
8. The differential matrix executes the same ruleset through sudo, sudo-rs, and
   OpenDoas with identical verdicts. *(C2, row 14)*

Rows 6–10 and 16 of the verification table are M3/M4 and are not part of this
exit. Packaging stays in phase 3.

## The sequence

### A. Resume *(mechanical)*

- A1. Main's head CI green; worktrees clean; each lane's agent reads its
  `RECOVERY-*.txt` and `git log` before touching anything. *(done 2026-10-21)*

### B. Merge queue, strict order

- **B1. Broker final** (`wf_87180089-132-1`, HEAD `7dcc41a`). Switch
  `SO_PEERCRED` to `Syscalls::peer_cred` (pid 0 is its own refusal, tested);
  close CONCERNS open item 8; revisit the "`/run/xudo` not shared across pid
  namespaces" note and keep it only with a reason; wire the audit contract if
  contained, else record D1 as the explicit next item with the stderr record
  kept. One squashed commit; gates; merge.
- **B2. Doctor round 5** (`wf_87180089-132-3`, HEAD `002230e`). Any line
  continuation, both dialects, → `Unverified`/`Maybe`, never `Clean`/`No`;
  tests for every real-sudo/doas case found in rounds 2–4 plus a generated
  property test; observer re-runs the real programs; merge. The oracle (D3) is
  the real fix for this class, and is recorded as such.
- **B3. Gate** (`wf_2a8abc38-d83-3`, HEAD `8e6152a`). Resume at the observer.
  Rebase onto the merged broker and reconcile three contracts before merging:
  consuming a spool entry that is already gone (`ENOENT`) is a refusal; one
  monotonic clock seam shared with the broker; the exec path takes
  `Authorized<_>` from the step-6 contract. Merge.
- **B4. Install** (`wf_2a8abc38-d83-4`, HEAD `9ce866e`). **DONE 2026-10-22** apart from the two items named in exit 6; the root lane is blocking. Finish the executor;
  make the post-install probe real against the merged gate (a safe no-op
  request that must execute as uid 0); dotted-filename regression; merge. Its
  real-file tests that need uid 0 join the root lane (`tests/root_*.rs`, run
  by `just root-test`), and that lane stops being non-blocking in the same
  commit: the three-step switch is written in the `root-tests` job in `ci.yml`.

### C. New builds *(after B; C1 before C2)*

- **C1. Step 3, `xudo exec`.** **Done 2026-10-29**, pty test included
  (`xudo-gate-bin/tests/root_probe.rs`, root lane, on a hand-driven pty rather than `rexpect`):
  `xudo exec -- <abs program> [args]` asks the broker, checks the gate path is
  `GATE_AUTH`, and `xudo-bin` execs `sudo`/`doas` on it in place; a human-only
  denial prints the `ido queue` line. Front-end round-trip over `xudo-wire`; exec of
  the backend's `PASSWD` hop; backend exit status passed through byte for byte;
  a denial whose remediation is "a human must run this" prints the exact
  `ido queue` line; `rexpect` test of the password prompt on a real pty. This is
  the first user-visible outcome of the milestone.
- **C2. Step 8, executing differential.** `xudo-tests` drives the static binary
  through sudo, sudo-rs, and OpenDoas in `ci/differential`'s containers, every
  verdict identical in every row; `row.sh` stops reporting the exec path as
  absent.

### D. Debts to clear before closeout *(parallel with C)*

- **D1. Audit integration, end to end.** Broker mint and gate exec take
  `Authorized<_>`; a successful root execution leaves both independent records;
  a direct hostile invocation and a denial leave theirs; a failing sink stops
  mint and execution; `xudo audit --log` passes on the produced trail and fails
  after truncation. Decide and record how a post-execution outcome is obtained
  with an exec-in-place gate. *Done 2026-10-29:* the broker writes the chained
  trail and mints only on an `Authorized<_>`; the unit and `tmpfiles` reach
  `/var/lib/xudo`; the root lane proves one chain with both records that
  verifies and fails when cut. The outcome is not obtained: the gate execs in
  place, so the record is the authorization (`CONCERNS.md`, 2026-10-29). The
  unit under a real systemd sandbox is not yet measured.
- **D2. Fuzz target** for the `xudo-wire` request parser, a trust-boundary
  parser `CLAUDE.md` requires fuzzing; wire it into `just fuzz`. *Done:*
  `fuzz/fuzz_targets/wire_request.rs` and `wire_response.rs`, both run by `just fuzz`.
- **D3. Doctor oracle.** **DONE 2026-10-29** for sudo and sudo-rs (as root, `sudo -l -U` per `xudo` group member; the reader is a hint, and a non-root run is unverified); doas stays on the reader, since `doas -C` needs a command to ask about. Ask the programs themselves — `sudo -l -U <user>` when
  run as root, `doas -C <file> <cmd>` unprivileged — as the authoritative
  passwordless check, demoting the hand parser to a hint. Four review rounds
  each found a new lexer mismatch; the parser cannot win that race.
- **D4. Flaky tests, owned.** `ido-bin` PTY `argv_is_never_passed_through_a_shell`
  (failed once under load); the `trust.rs` socket tests that hit `SUN_LEN` on a
  long checkout path. Fix, or pin with the reason written beside the test.
- **D5. CI gaps.** The systemd unit assertions (`xudod/tests/units.rs`) and a
  root-in-container lane for the install tests join `just verify`/CI.
- **D6. Inventories.** The crate tables in `CLAUDE.md`, `design-plan.md`, and
  `README.md` (this directory) name the real workspace members, with `xudod`
  marked in review until B1 lands.

### E. Closeout and decisions *(user sign-off)*

- **E1. M2b closeout.** Sweep the verification table against the exit test
  above; `howiwork.md` "Where the build stands" and the FigJam card re-stamped;
  a dated `CONCERNS.md` entry.
- **E2. Phase 3 beta `.deb`** — human path only, no `NOPASSWD` shipped. *Decision:
  release timing.*
- **E3. Schedule the `howiwork.md` promises with no milestone:** vision-mode
  providers, YAML/JSON permission-set import, pasban's schedule and log
  verification, `airead`. *Decision: proposed homes M5/M6/phase 5.*

Temporary permissions (requested 2026-10-21) are specified in `howiwork.md`
and scheduled as the first part of M5 in `README.md`; they are not M2b work.

## Estimates

Measured burn this cycle: about 2M agent tokens and 2–2.5 hours per completed
step (build, review, fix, merge, green CI); gateway failures roughly doubled it
at their worst. From that: B ≈ 3–5M tokens, C ≈ 4–6M, D ≈ 2–3M; about 12–17
hours of agent time to E1, more if the gate's review finds what gates usually
do. The whole roadmap after M2b (phase 3, M3–M7) is an order of magnitude
larger and includes work no agent can do: an external audit and a VM for the
kernel-version and systemd-scope matrix.
