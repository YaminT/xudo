//! The second decision, made from root's state.
//!
//! The front-end already decided. That verdict does not travel: it ran in a
//! process the caller controls, so the gate re-derives everything and consults
//! the spool entry only for the *question*.
//!
//! # What the gate refuses that the front-end cannot
//!
//! Three refusals exist only here, because only here are they meaningful:
//!
//! * **No pending request.** The expected shape of a hostile invocation. `sudo
//!   /usr/libexec/xudo/xudo-gate-auth` is available to every member of the
//!   `xudo` group by design; with no entry to act on, the gate exits non-zero
//!   having done nothing privileged, and says so at high severity.
//! * **An unconfirmed action whose rule demands confirmation.** The gate has no
//!   confirmation channel — every terminal it can reach belongs to the process
//!   tree that asked — so it cannot supply what is missing. Invariant 3 makes
//!   this a refusal rather than a prompt.
//! * **A program that is not the program the rule names.** Caught by
//!   [`xudo_policy::evaluate`] via the exe comparison, which is why the entry's
//!   `program` is passed through to it rather than trusted.
//!
//! # Severity is about what the refusal implies, not how bad it sounds
//!
//! An expired request is a race: the human took too long, the deadline passed,
//! nothing is wrong. A request naming a *different caller* is someone trying to
//! use an approval that was granted to another process. Both are refusals; only
//! one is worth waking someone for. [`Severity`] carries that distinction so the
//! audit sink can route on it, and it is derived from the refusal rather than
//! chosen at each call site, where it would drift.
