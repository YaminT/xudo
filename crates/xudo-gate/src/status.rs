//! Reporting the child's fate without softening it.
//!
//! When the gate execs a privileged child, the caller's exit status must be the
//! child's exit status. This sounds like a detail and is not: a wrapper that
//! collapses every failure to `1` breaks `set -e` scripts, hides the difference
//! between "the package was already installed" (`apt-get` exit 0) and "the
//! archive is corrupt" (exit 100), and — worse for this project — makes a
//! *denial* indistinguishable from a command that ran and failed. `xudo` reserves
//! 17 to 19 for its own refusals and passes everything else through. The
//! exec-in-place gate cannot keep that range apart: a child may exit with the
//! same numbers, so only the refusal line on standard error says which it was.
//! [`Termination`] is for a wait-based front-end (plan item C1); the gate
//! itself never waits and does not use it.
//!
//! # The shell convention, and why signals are not exit codes
//!
//! A child killed by a signal has no exit code. Unix's answer, which every shell
//! implements and `sudo` follows, is to report `128 + signal`. It is a
//! convention, not a kernel fact, and it is lossy — exit code 137 and "killed by
//! SIGKILL" are the same number — so [`Termination`] keeps the distinction
//! internally and flattens it only at the process boundary, where it must. The
//! audit record gets the unflattened form via [`Termination::outcome`].
//!
//! # Decoding, done here rather than with libc macros
//!
//! `WIFEXITED` and friends are C macros, unavailable through a Rust FFI
//! declaration, and each libc binding reimplements them anyway. Reimplementing
//! them here — in a pure module, with a test per branch — is both the honest and
//! the testable option: this crate takes no `unsafe`, and a fabricated status
//! word exercises every arm without spawning a process.
