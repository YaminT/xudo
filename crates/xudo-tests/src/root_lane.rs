//! The one guard every root test begins with.
//!
//! A root test writes to the real `/etc`, replaces the installed gate, deletes
//! the audit log and binds journald's socket. Run as root on a real machine
//! (`sudo just test`, and `--all-features` turns the `root-tests` feature on)
//! that deletes an operator's `/etc/doas.conf` and the host's audit trail. Being
//! uid 0 is therefore not permission to run: the test must also find the
//! sentinel `ci/root-test.sh` puts inside the throwaway container.
//!
//! * Not root: the test skips and says `SKIPPED:`, which `ci/root-test.sh`
//!   turns into a failure, so the only accepted skip is the one nobody relies
//!   on (the suites that enable every feature, run as an ordinary user).
//! * Root, and the sentinel is there and is what the lane writes: it runs.
//! * Root, and anything else: the test **panics**, before it has touched
//!   anything. Never a skip: a skip is a green build on the machine where a
//!   guard mattered.
//!
//! The sentinel is a file because nothing privileged may read the environment
//! to decide what it is allowed to do, and an environment variable is one
//! `export` away from set. A file directly under `/` can only be made by root,
//! and root on a real host has not made it. It must be a regular file (not a
//! link), root's, writable by no one else, and exactly the bytes the lane
//! writes.

// The guard exists to stop a test by panicking; a skip would be a green build
// on the machine where it mattered.
