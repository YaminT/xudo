//! Where a writer picks a chain up.
//!
//! A privileged writer appends to a log it has not read in full: reading every
//! record on every request would make each decision cost the whole history of
//! the machine. So it reads the end of the log, finds the last record, and
//! builds the next one after it. This module is that step, pure, so every shape
//! a damaged log can end in is a test case rather than a disk image.
//!
//! # What a writer refuses, and why it never starts over
//!
//! A log whose end is not a record a writer can continue from is **damage**:
//! a write that did not finish (a crash, a full disk), a last line someone
//! edited, bytes that are not a record at all, or an end so long without a
//! complete line that the record before it is out of the window. A writer
//! stops there. It does not append after the damage, because the new record
//! would follow a predecessor nobody can read; and it does not start a new
//! chain, because a fresh `seq 1` after the damage would make everything before
//! it unverifiable while looking like an ordinary log. The repair is a
//! person's: move the log aside, which starts a new chain *deliberately* and
//! keeps the damaged one as evidence.
//!
//! The verifier agrees by construction. [`crate::verify_log`] — what
//! `xudo audit` runs — checks every record and then asks [`continuation_of`]
//! about the end of the log, which reads the same window through the same
//! function a writer does. So every ending a writer refuses, the verifier
//! reports: as the line, when the damage is a line, and as the writer's own
//! refusal when it is not. A writer reads only the end; damage further back is
//! the verifier's alone to find.
//!
//! One shape is not damage: a complete, sealed last record missing only its
//! newline. Nothing in it is lost, the verifier reads it, and the writer begins
//! its own record on a new line rather than refusing every request over one
//! missing byte.
//!
//! # What it cannot see
//!
//! A log cut back at a record boundary ends in a perfectly good record, and a
//! log cut back to nothing — or to blank lines — holds no record at all.
//! Nothing in the file can tell the first from a log that simply stopped there,
//! or the second from a new one, so a writer continues the first and starts a
//! fresh chain at `seq 1` in the second, silently. Both need root or a disk
//! fault. Only a comparison with the journal entries root sent, which carry
//! each record's `seq` and hash, could show either, and no tool makes it yet.
