//! The rest of identifying the process on the other end of a socket, behind a
//! seam of its own.
//!
//! [`crate::Syscalls`] is the list of calls that need `unsafe`: of the peer
//! calls, `SO_PEERPIDFD`, `PIDFD_GET_INFO`, and `SO_PEERCRED`. The calls that
//! are safe in rustix are `pidfd_open`, a poll on a pidfd, and two reads of
//! `/proc/<pid>` by number, and those live here, behind [`PeerCalls`].
//! `SO_PEERCRED` is on this seam as well, but only as a seam: [`HostPeer`]
//! answers it through [`crate::Syscalls::peer_cred`], which decodes the
//! kernel's record into plain integers (`xudo-sys-raw`, the sixth `unsafe`
//! block), after a check of the socket's kind. It never answers it through
//! rustix's `socket_peercred`, which decodes the pid into a type that cannot be
//! zero and so is undefined behaviour on the pid 0 the kernel reports for a
//! peer outside this process's pid namespace; `clippy.toml` bans that function.
//! Having every peer call behind [`PeerCalls`] lets the attestation ladder
//! built on both seams in `xudod` be driven through every rung and every
//! refusal by [`FakePeer`] on any platform, including the orders of events a
//! real kernel will not produce on demand: a peer that exits between the
//! broker's read of `/proc` and its re-check through the pidfd, and a peer the
//! kernel reports as pid 0.
//!
//! # What each answer is worth
//!
//! * `SO_PEERCRED` is the kernel's record of the peer **at connect time**: its
//!   pid number, effective uid, and effective gid. On every rung, this is the
//!   identity the broker binds a request to.
//! * A `/proc/<pid>` read is by **number**, and a number can be reissued once
//!   its process is reaped. So a read proves nothing on its own; it is
//!   confirmed afterwards through a pidfd, by [`PeerCalls::has_exited`].
//! * A poll on a pidfd reports readable once the process has exited, and a
//!   process that has not exited has not been reaped, so its number still
//!   names it.
//!
//! The predicates at the bottom of this module — [`lacks_peer_pidfd`],
//! [`lacks_pidfd_open`], [`lacks_pidfd_info`] — are how a caller decides the
//! rung by **asking the kernel** rather than reading its version: a
//! distribution kernel can carry a call long before the upstream version that
//! introduced it, and only the errno says which calls exist here.
