//! Whether the filesystems under the ruleset are ones a non-root user made.
//!
//! The trust walk in [`crate::trust`] checks every component's owner and mode on
//! the descriptor it opened. That evidence is only as good as the filesystem
//! reporting it. A FUSE filesystem reports whatever owner and mode its daemon
//! likes, and any user can mount one through the set-user-ID `fusermount3`; an
//! idmapped mount reports owners through a mapping; removable media a user
//! mounted holds whatever that user wrote on it. So the walk matches every
//! descriptor it opens to its mount, and judges the mount before it believes
//! anything else about the component.
//!
//! # Which mount a descriptor is on
//!
//! The one `/proc/thread-self/fdinfo/<fd>` names as `mnt_id`, which is the first
//! field of that mount's line in `/proc/thread-self/mountinfo`. Exact. `mnt_id`
//! is in fdinfo since Linux 3.15 and `/proc/thread-self` exists since 3.17; on
//! an older kernel the read fails, and a read that fails refuses.
//!
//! Not by `st_dev`. btrfs gives every subvolume a device number of its own, and
//! none of them appears in mountinfo, so on a btrfs root — Fedora's default — no
//! descriptor's `st_dev` matches any mount at all; overlayfs reports a per-layer
//! device for some files; and two mounts of one filesystem share a device while
//! differing in exactly the options judged below. Measured on Linux 6.12: two
//! btrfs mounts listed as `0:72`, files on them reporting `0:73` and `0:74`, and
//! `fdinfo` telling the two mounts of subvolume `0:74` apart (see
//! `docs/CONCERNS.md`, 2026-10-19).
//!
//! The id cannot be reissued to another mount while the descriptor is open,
//! because an open descriptor keeps its mount alive. A mount detached after the
//! open simply stops being listed, and an unlisted mount is refused.
//!
//! # What is refused
//!
//! The kernel does not record who asked for a mount. In the initial user
//! namespace every mount needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, so a non-root user mounts only
//! through something running as root on their behalf — the set-user-ID
//! `fusermount3` and `mount(8)`, or the udisks2 daemon — and each leaves marks:
//!
//! * `fusermount3` records the user as the FUSE filesystem's `user_id`. A
//!   `fuse`, `fuseblk`, or `fuse.<subtype>` mount is refused unless it names
//!   exactly one `user_id` and that is `0`.
//! * `fusermount3`, udisks2, and `mount(8)` for an fstab entry marked `user`,
//!   `users`, `owner`, or `group` all mount `nosuid`; `user` and `users` imply
//!   `noexec` as well. Under the ruleset a mount carrying either is refused, as
//!   the design plan says of `/etc/xudo` ([`MountPolicy::Ruleset`]). Under any
//!   other root-owned path it is not: root's own mounts carry the same marks —
//!   `/run`, which holds the gate's spool, is `nosuid` on every systemd host —
//!   so there they are evidence of nothing ([`MountPolicy::RootPath`]).
//! * An `idmapped` mount reports owners translated through a mapping chosen at
//!   mount time, not the owners on disk. Refused to every reader.
//! * A thread outside the initial user namespace reads uid 0 as that
//!   namespace's owner rather than root, and the kernel prints a FUSE mount's
//!   `user_id` relative to the user namespace the mount was made in, which
//!   mountinfo does not name. Everything is refused there. A kernel built
//!   without user namespaces has only the initial one.
//!
//! What is accepted, and why, is recorded in `docs/CONCERNS.md`: in short,
//! anything else root mounted, network and virtual filesystems included,
//! because root chose to put it there.
//!
//! # Where the table comes from
//!
//! `/proc`, and believed only on proof: every file is read through a descriptor
//! that `fstatfs` reports to be on procfs, because a hostile mount over `/proc`
//! could otherwise hand back a table of its choosing. `thread-self` rather than
//! `self`: the walk resolved its paths in this thread's mount namespace, and the
//! descriptors are in this thread's descriptor table. Anything that cannot be
//! read, parsed, or found refuses.
