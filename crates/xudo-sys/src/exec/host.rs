//! The one place `xudo` starts a child process.
//!
//! Isolated into its own file because it is the only code in the workspace whose
//! failure paths cannot be reached from a test: they need the kernel to fail a
//! `fork` or a pipe read on a descriptor we own. Every *decision* built on a
//! probe result lives behind [`crate::exec::Runner`] and is fully covered
//! against a fake, so what is excluded here is process plumbing and nothing
//! else. The exclusion is recorded in the `justfile` next to the other two.
//!
//! # Why `Command::new` is used here despite being banned
//!
//! `clippy.toml` disallows `std::process::Command::new` project-wide, because
//! resolving an executable through `PATH` means the caller chooses the binary.
//! The ban is lifted for exactly this function, under exactly these conditions:
//!
//! * the path must be **absolute**, checked at run time and not by convention;
//! * the environment is **cleared and rebuilt**, so no `LD_PRELOAD`,
//!   `GLIBC_TUNABLES`, `BASH_ENV`, or proxy variable reaches the child;
//! * the argv is fixed by the caller in code, never assembled from a request;
//! * stdin is either closed or a fixed byte string this crate wrote.
//!
//! This is **not** the privileged exec path. That one needs `openat2` resolution
//! from a pinned directory descriptor, an ancestor ownership walk, and
//! `execveat` on the descriptor that was validated rather than the path that was
//! checked. Do not grow this file into that one.
