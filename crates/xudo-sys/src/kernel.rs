//! Which kernel this is, and therefore which attestation is available.
//!
//! `xudo` cannot require a 2025 kernel. Ubuntu 20.04 ships 5.4, Debian 11 ships
//! 5.10, and RHEL 9 ships 5.14 — all of them still in service, and all of them
//! missing the syscall the primary attestation path is built on. So the path is
//! a **ladder**, and this module decides which rung a host is on.
//!
//! # The rungs, and what each one actually proves
//!
//! | Rung | Since | What the broker learns about its peer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Attestation::PeerPidfdInfo`] | 6.13 | A pidfd straight from the socket, then its pid and cgroup id through `PIDFD_GET_INFO` |
//! | [`Attestation::PeerPidfd`] | 6.5 | A pidfd straight from the socket via `SO_PEERPIDFD` |
//! | [`Attestation::PidfdOpen`] | 5.3 | A pid from `SO_PEERCRED`, then `pidfd_open` on it, then a re-check |
//! | [`Attestation::PeerCredOnly`] | 2.2 | A pid, and no way to stop it being reused |
//!
//! On every rung the peer's uid and gid come from `SO_PEERCRED`, which the
//! kernel captured when the peer connected. `PIDFD_GET_INFO` also reports
//! credentials, but **current** ones, read at the moment of the call: a peer
//! that connected and then exec'd a set-user-ID program would report that
//! program's ids. What a pidfd makes race-free is *which process* it names,
//! not what that process's credentials or cgroup were at connect time.
//!
//! The distinction that matters is not convenience, it is whether the process
//! can be **pinned**. `SO_PEERCRED` hands back a pid, and a pid is a name that
//! can be recycled: the process that connected may have exited and its number
//! been reissued to something else before the broker looks at `/proc`. A pidfd
//! is a handle to that specific process, and it never comes to refer to
//! another one.
//!
//! It does **not** hold on to the process's number. The kernel releases a pid
//! number when the process is reaped, even while a pidfd still refers to the
//! process, and the next process may be issued it. So whatever the broker reads
//! from `/proc/<pid>` by number — the start time that pins a request to its
//! caller, and on 6.5 to 6.12 the cgroup too — may describe a different
//! process, unless the broker confirms through the pidfd *after* the last such
//! read that the process it pinned is still unreaped. Every rung that holds a
//! pidfd re-checks this way; see [`Attestation::needs_recheck_after_pinning`].
//!
//! On [`Attestation::PidfdOpen`] the pidfd is opened and the identity is then
//! *re-read through it* and compared, which closes the gap between the
//! broker's first look and the pin. It does not close the gap before that:
//! `SO_PEERCRED` reports the pid number the peer had at connect time, the
//! kernel returns that number to the allocator once the peer is reaped, and a
//! same-uid process that is issued it afterwards looks identical to every
//! re-check, because nothing the connection carries besides the number and the
//! uid is left to compare against. So the pin names *a* process, not provably
//! the one that connected. That is enough for an audit record and for binding
//! a human-path request, where the password is the authority; it is not enough
//! to grant root without one.
//!
//! On [`Attestation::PeerCredOnly`] there is no pin at all. Neither rung can
//! **carry the agent path**: see [`Attestation::can_attest_an_agent`]. A
//! re-check that binds the pinned process to *this* connection — finding the
//! client end of the accepted socket in the pinned process's descriptor table,
//! through `sock_diag` — could restore it on 5.3 to 6.4, and is M4's to build
//! or not. This is invariant 2 of the project —
//! misclassification may only withhold capability — applied to the kernel
//! itself. An old kernel loses passwordless operation. It does not lose `xudo`;
//! the human path still works, because a human typing a password is not relying
//! on the broker knowing which process asked.
//!
//! # Path resolution degrades too, and loses nothing
//!
//! `openat2` with `RESOLVE_NO_SYMLINKS | RESOLVE_BENEATH` arrived in 5.6. Below
//! that, [`Resolution::NofollowWalk`] opens one component at a time with
//! `O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY` from a pinned dirfd. For `xudo` this is
//! not a weaker check: the ruleset walk **refuses** a symlinked component rather
//! than resolving it, and refuses `..` outright, so there is nothing for
//! `RESOLVE_BENEATH` to protect against that `O_NOFOLLOW` plus no-`..` does not
//! already cover. `openat2` is preferred because it is one syscall instead of N,
//! not because the fallback is unsound.
//!
//! # Failure posture
//!
//! An unparseable version is [`KernelVersion::UNKNOWN`], which sits below every
//! threshold and therefore lands on the lowest rung — no agent path. A kernel we
//! cannot identify is treated as the oldest one we support, never the newest.
