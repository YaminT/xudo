//! The hash-chained log on disk: the trail's authority.
//!
//! # Where, and why not `/var/log`
//!
//! [`AUDIT_DIR`]`/`[`AUDIT_FILE_NAME`] — `/var/lib/xudo/audit.jsonl`, mode
//! `0600`, in the root directory that holds the broker's other state (`0700`
//! as packaged; the writer itself demands only what the walk demands, that no
//! group or other can write it). The mode keeps other users out of the file;
//! the same records also reach the journal, which `adm` and `systemd-journal`
//! can read. Not `/var/log/xudo`, which the design plan first named:
//!
//! * On Ubuntu `/var/log` is `root:syslog 0775`: rsyslog's package makes it
//!   group-writable. A directory beneath it fails the ancestor walk every
//!   privileged write target must pass, and rightly so — the `syslog` group can
//!   rename `/var/log/xudo` aside and put its own directory in its place.
//! * `/var/log` is where rotation truncates and renames, and where RAM-backed
//!   setups (log2ram) keep files that never reach a disk. A chain must survive
//!   the first, and `fdatasync` on a RAM disk persists nothing.
//! * The log a person reads is the journal. This file is evidence.
//!
//! # How a record is appended
//!
//! 1. The directory is opened by the descriptor walk from `/`
//!    ([`open_trusted`]): every component root's, none writable by group or
//!    world, none a link.
//! 2. The log is opened relative to that descriptor with
//!    `O_RDWR|O_APPEND|O_CREAT|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC` and mode `0600`. A link
//!    planted where the log should be — dangling or not — is refused, never
//!    written through and never used to create a file elsewhere.
//! 3. `fstat` on that descriptor: a regular file, owned by root, with no
//!    access for group or other, and exactly one name. A second name
//!    (`st_nlink > 1`) is a path to the log that skips the walk.
//! 4. An exclusive `flock`, waited for within a bound, so the broker's
//!    instances and the gate append one at a time. Past the bound: refuse.
//!    Once it is held, `fstat` again and `statat` the name without following
//!    it: the file locked must still have exactly one name, and the directory
//!    must still name it (same device and inode). In the seconds a writer can
//!    wait, the log can be moved aside — as the damaged-tail refusal tells an
//!    operator to do — or deleted, and a record appended then would land in a
//!    file that is no longer the chain, or in none. When it is not, the
//!    writer closes it and opens the log again, within the same bound.
//! 5. The last record is found from the end of the log
//!    ([`xudo_audit::continuation`]); the caller's record is built after it,
//!    checked to follow it and to pass the caller's own check, and refused if
//!    it is longer than [`xudo_audit::MAX_RECORD_BYTES`].
//! 6. One `write` of the whole line, then `fdatasync` — and, for a log's first
//!    record, `fsync` of the directory too, since `fdatasync` makes the data
//!    durable but not the name the file was just created under.
//! 7. The record goes to the trail's mirrors (journald), the lock still held.
//!
//! Any failure from the write on — the write itself, `fdatasync`, the
//! directory `fsync`, a mirror — cuts the log back to where it ended and syncs
//! the cut, before the lock is released. So the next writer never finds a torn
//! tail from a full disk, and never chains onto a record nobody holds a
//! receipt for: not one whose `fdatasync` failed (on Linux that error is
//! reported once, so its own `fdatasync` could succeed while the earlier page
//! never reached the disk), and not a first record whose directory entry may
//! not survive a crash (the cut leaves the log without a record, so the next
//! writer syncs the directory itself). If the cut fails too, the next writer
//! finds what is left: a torn tail, which it refuses, or a whole record, which
//! it continues from — the case this cannot close.
//!
//! A receipt is made only after step 7. A log that ends in damage stops the
//! writer at step 5, for the reasons in [`xudo_audit::tail`].
//!
//! On macOS, the development host, several writers *creating* the log at once
//! can see `openat(O_CREAT)` fail with `ENOENT` for all but one of them — an
//! XNU behaviour that path-based `open` does not share. That fails closed, and
//! Linux creates under the directory's lock, where it cannot happen.
