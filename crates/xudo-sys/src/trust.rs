//! Whether the rules on disk are the rules root wrote.
//!
//! Every other guarantee in `xudo` rests on this one. The policy engine is a
//! pure function of the ruleset, so anyone who can edit the ruleset — or edit
//! anything on the path to it — decides what an agent may run. Checking the
//! file's own owner and mode is not enough:
//!
//! * A **symlink** anywhere on the path redirects the load. `/etc/xudo` owned by
//!   root but *reachable* through a directory a user can write is a directory a
//!   user can replace.
//! * A **writable ancestor** is the same attack one level up. If `/etc/xudo` is
//!   perfect but `/etc` is group-writable, the group can rename `xudo` aside and
//!   put its own there. Nothing about the final file looks wrong afterwards.
//! * A **group- or world-writable** file needs no attack at all.
//!
//! So the check walks from the filesystem root down to the target and demands
//! the same three properties of every component. That is the "ancestor ownership
//! walk", and it is the reason this module exists before the executor does: an
//! exec path that trusts an unverified ruleset is not a privilege broker, it is
//! a privilege escalation.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`verify`] is pure: it takes the facts already gathered and returns the
//! **first** component that fails, with the reason. Gathering the facts is
//! [`stat_path`], which is the only part that touches a filesystem. The split is
//! what makes every refusal reachable from a test without needing to be root.
//!
//! # The filesystem under each component
//!
//! An owner and a mode are what a filesystem reports, and some filesystems will
//! report anything: a FUSE filesystem a user mounted answers every `stat` from
//! that user's daemon. So [`open_trusted`], [`read_trusted_dir`], and
//! [`load_trusted_rules`] also match every descriptor they open to its mount in
//! `/proc/thread-self/mountinfo` and refuse a mount whose word on ownership is
//! not taken; `crate::mounts` says which and why.
//!
//! The mount comes first. On Linux each component is opened `O_PATH`, which
//! asks its filesystem nothing — crossing into the root of a FUSE mount does
//! not reach the daemon — and its mount is judged before its owner and mode
//! are read from that descriptor, and before anything beneath it is looked up.
//! So a user's daemon is never asked anything: it can neither choose which
//! refusal the operator is shown nor stall the walk, and the refusal names the
//! outermost component at fault. Whatever is read is opened once more, since
//! nothing can be read through `O_PATH`, and refused unless it is the inode
//! that passed. Off Linux there is no mount table, so these three refuse
//! everything there.
