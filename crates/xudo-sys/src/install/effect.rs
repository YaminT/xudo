//! Whether the backend would honour the rule that was just written.
//!
//! A file in `/etc/sudoers.d` proves nothing: `sudo` skips a name with a dot in
//! it and `sudo-rs` ignores directives it does not support. So after an install
//! the question is put to the backend itself, which is the only thing that
//! knows: `sudo -l -U <user>` lists what that user may run, and the gate is
//! either in the list or it is not.
//!
//! **This is not the functional probe, and it is never reported as success.**
//! It shows the rule is read; it does not show the gate runs as uid 0, which
//! needs a request minted through the broker (plan item C1). It prints on a
//! line of its own, beside the `NOT VERIFIED` that the missing probe produces.
//!
//! The group the rule grants to starts empty, by design (membership is the
//! privilege grant). With no member there is no one to ask about, and that is
//! reported as it is — unchecked — rather than inferred either way. `doas` has
//! no question that takes a group or a user, so it is unchecked too.
