//! Executing the install plan.
//!
//! `xudo-backend` decides what to write and in what order and never touches a
//! file. This module is the other half: it takes that plan and performs it,
//! through [`InstallOps`], so that every ordering rule and every failure path
//! is driven against a fake and measured, and only the file operations
//! themselves ([`HostInstallOps`]) need a real directory.
//!
//! # What the executor refuses on its own
//!
//! The plan is data, and an executor that does whatever a plan says is a root
//! write primitive for whoever can build one. So before any step runs:
//!
//! * **Root only.** An effective uid other than 0 is refused first, before the
//!   plan is even read.
//! * **Only files xudo writes.** Every path a step names must be one of the five
//!   xudo's snippets install to, or the candidate beside one. `/etc/sudoers`,
//!   `/etc/passwd`, and anything else are refused, so the executor cannot touch
//!   a file it did not write however the plan was assembled.
//! * **No name sudo ignores.** A drop-in whose name contains a dot or ends in
//!   `~` is silently skipped by sudo, so an install onto one would report
//!   success and grant nothing. Refused before it can happen.
//! * **No writable modes.** A file xudo installs is `0440` or `0400`; a mode
//!   with any write bit, or any access for others, is refused.
//! * **One validator, one candidate.** A validator that never names the
//!   candidate checks nothing, so its argv must contain `{candidate}` exactly
//!   once and start with an absolute path.
//!
//! and while it runs:
//!
//! * **Validate before install, structurally.** An `Install` step is refused
//!   unless the candidate it names was written by this run and validated by
//!   this run, in that order, and the inode that was validated is the inode
//!   that was written.
//! * **On any failure the candidate is removed** (only if it is still the inode
//!   this run created) and the previous file is never touched: the rename is
//!   the last act, and it is atomic.
//!
//! # What "installed" does and does not mean
//!
//! The plan's last real step is a functional probe: run the gate through the
//! backend and see it execute as uid 0. The gate exists, but minting the request
//! it waits for needs a broker client in the front-end (M2b plan item C1), so
//! [`InstallProbe`] is the seam and the only production implementation,
//! [`PendingGateProbe`], answers [`ProbeResult::Unavailable`]: a completed
//! install reports [`Verification::Unverified`] with the reason, never
//! "verified". A file in `/etc/sudoers.d` proves nothing: `sudo-rs` ignores
//! directives it does not support, and `sudo` ignores a badly named file
//! entirely. What the host installer adds is [`check_effect`], the backend's own
//! answer to "do you read this rule", as a notice of its own; it is not the probe.
