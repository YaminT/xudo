//! `xudod`, the root broker: the only thing that mints the requests the gate
//! acts on.
//!
//! The gate refuses with `NoPendingRequest` unless a root-minted entry exists
//! under `/run/xudo/req`, so without this broker nothing `xudo` decides can be
//! executed — the human path included. M2b's broker does exactly one job:
//!
//! 1. take one connection from systemd, as descriptor 0;
//! 2. identify the peer from the kernel, by the attestation ladder;
//! 3. classify it `Unattested` — there is no cgroup classification until M4,
//!    so every caller takes the human path, with a password;
//! 4. evaluate the request against root's ruleset, with the same function
//!    `xudo explain` uses;
//! 5. on a permitted decision, mint the spool entry the gate reads;
//! 6. answer with the decision and, if one was minted, the nonce, the deadline,
//!    and the gate to run.
//!
//! No confirmation channel, no `freeze`, no cgroups: those are M3 and M4.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! The broker runs as root and trusts nothing it is sent. The request carries
//! only the question; who asked comes from `SO_PEERCRED` and a pidfd, and what
//! is allowed comes from root's ruleset, read through verified descriptors.
//! Every syscall is behind a seam in `xudo-sys`, so every refusal below is
//! reached by a test on a laptop, without root.
//!
//! | Module | Answers |

//! | [`identify`] | Who is on the other end of the socket? |
//! | [`policy`] | What does root's policy decide about this command? |
//! | [`mint`] | What does the gate's entry say, and what may stay in the spool? |
//! | [`record`] | What does the audit trail say about this answer? |
//! | [`refusal`] | What is the client told when the answer is no answer? |
//! | [`serve`] | In what order, and what happens when a step fails? |
