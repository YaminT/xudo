//! Who is on the other end of the socket, by the attestation ladder.
//!
//! The rung is decided by **asking the kernel**, one call at a time, never by
//! reading its version — a distribution kernel can carry a call years before
//! the upstream version that introduced it:
//!
//! ```text
//! SO_PEERCRED                          connect-time pid, euid, egid   (every rung)
//! SO_PEERPIDFD   ENOPROTOOPT -> pidfd_open(pid)   ENOSYS -> no pidfd (PeerCredOnly)
//! PIDFD_GET_INFO ENOTTY/EINVAL -> no record       (PeerPidfd, or PidfdOpen)
//! /proc/<pid>/stat     the start time the request is pinned by
//! /proc/<pid>/status   the euid it runs as now, if no record said
//! poll(pidfd)          after the last /proc read: still unreaped?
//! ```
//!
//! Only the errno that means "this kernel lacks the call" drops a rung. Every
//! other failure is a refusal, above all the ones that mean the peer is gone:
//! falling to a lower rung after a failure would look the peer up by a pid
//! number that may now belong to someone else.
//!
//! # What the pin is, and why the re-check comes last
//!
//! A request is bound to `(pid, starttime)`, both read by number: the pid from
//! `SO_PEERCRED`, the start time from `/proc/<pid>/stat`. A number can be
//! reissued once its process is reaped, even while a pidfd still refers to the
//! process. So after the last `/proc` read, the broker polls the pidfd: a
//! process that has not exited has not been reaped, so the number it read
//! still named the pinned process when it read it. A peer that exited is
//! refused, however far identification had got.
//!
//! # Credentials are compared, not trusted twice
//!
//! The euid the request is attributed to is `SO_PEERCRED`'s, captured when the
//! peer connected. The euid the peer runs as *now* — from `PIDFD_GET_INFO` if
//! the kernel answers it, otherwise from `/proc/<pid>/status` — must equal it:
//! a peer that connected and then exec'd a set-user-ID program is a different
//! program with different authority, and is refused.
//!
//! # What none of this decides
//!
//! Classification. In M2b every caller is `Unattested`, so nothing here grants
//! anything; the identity binds the request and fills the audit record. The
//! rung is still recorded honestly, because M4 will rest authority on it.
