//! The gate's whole sequence, written against traits.
//!
//! `aido-gate-bin` is five lines: it collects `argv`, hands it to [`run`] with
//! the real host, and exits with the status that comes back. Everything the
//! gate does is here, in the order it does it, so that each step is a place a
//! test can make fail and see that nothing after it ran.
//!
//! # The order, and why each step is where it is
//!
//! 1. **`close_range(3, ~0, CLOEXEC)`.** First, before the gate opens anything
//!    of its own: whatever `sudo` or the caller leaked above descriptor 2 is
//!    marked to close at the exec, so the child inherits none of it. On a
//!    kernel before 5.11 the call is refused and so is the gate; marking each
//!    descriptor by hand would be another `unsafe` block, and a pre-5.11 host
//!    is not one the beta supports.
//! 2. **`/dev/null` for closed 0 to 2.** Before the first `open`, which would
//!    otherwise take a closed descriptor's number and make the audit log the
//!    gate's standard error.
//! 3. **`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`.** Irreversible and inherited by the exec, so
//!    nothing the gate runs gains privilege from a set-user-ID or
//!    file-capability binary. Set before anything is consumed, so a host that
//!    refuses costs the caller nothing.
//! 4. **The invocation.** No arguments, and `argv[0]` is the `-auth` name.
//!    `aido-gate-nopass` is not shipped until M4, so any other name is refused.
//! 5. **`/proc` verified as procfs**, on the descriptor it is read through.
//! 6. **The lineage walk**: the gate, `sudo` or `sudo-rs` (with its `use_pty`
//!    monitor) or `doas`, and then the `aido` process that asked, each pinned
//!    by `(pid, starttime)`, bounded at [`LINEAGE_PROCESSES`] processes. The
//!    names the walk reads are hints and go in the audit record; nothing
//!    branches on them. What the walk yields is a set of pins, and the next
//!    step matches an entry to one of them.
//! 7. **The ruleset**, only through `aido_sys::load_trusted_rules`. The
//!    generation is [`aido_policy::Generation::id`] of what was loaded, the
//!    value the broker minted against.
//! 8. **The spool and the clock.** The broker's spool, opened through the trust
//!    walk and seen through [`RequestSpool`], which can list, read and consume
//!    and nothing else; at most [`MAX_SPOOL_NAMES`] names are walked, and the
//!    listing is cut off one name past that, so a crowded spool is refused
//!    without being read to its end. Every
//!    entry named by a nonce is read on a descriptor of its own. Exactly one
//!    must be pinned to an ancestor: none is [`Refusal::NoPendingRequest`],
//!    more than one is refused. The clock is the broker's, [`aido_sys::HostClock`]:
//!    one `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` that a deadline is stamped and judged on, and a
//!    reading of zero is refused as no reading.
//! 9. **`validate`, then [`decide`]**, then **consume**: the entry is unlinked
//!    through the verified directory descriptor before anything executes, and
//!    a failed unlink — `ENOENT` included, which means a second gate took it
//!    first ([`aido_sys::SpoolError::Gone`]) — is a refusal. An entry is
//!    therefore used at most once. This is the one place the broker's own
//!    `remove`, for which a missing name is success, must not be used.
//! 10. **The program**, opened through the trust walk and judged and hashed on
//!     that descriptor. A `#!` script is refused as a script.
//! 11. **The audit record**, through [`aido_sys::authorize`], before the exec.
//!     A gate that cannot write its record refuses, and the exec takes the
//!     [`Authorized`] that only a written record makes.
//! 12. **`execveat(fd, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH)`**, with the argument vector built
//!     from the canonical argv *bytes* and the environment from
//!     [`crate::child_environment`].
//!
//! # The process model: exec in place
//!
//! The gate replaces itself with the command. The alternative is to fork, wait,
//! and report the outcome, and it is rejected for three reasons. `fork` has no
//! safe wrapper, so it would be a further `unsafe` block in the one crate that
//! has a published budget for them. A waiting root parent holds every
//! descriptor it inherited, and `close_range` marks rather than closes. And
//! exec in place gives the faithful exit status and signal for free, since
//! `sudo`'s own parent is what reaps the command. What it costs is an outcome
//! record: the authorization is written before the exec, and nothing is left
//! to write after it. The one outcome the gate can still learn is an exec that
//! fails, which it records as a second entry naming the authorization.
//!
//! # What a refusal says, and to whom
//!
//! The gate writes its refusal to the audit trail (best effort: a refusal
//! stands without its record) and prints one line to standard error, the
//! stable code and severity only. Nothing from the spool, the ruleset or the
//! environment reaches that line.
