//! The spool entry, and the four facts checked before the ruleset is consulted.
//!
//! The gate takes no arguments — the sudoers rule enforces `""` — and reads
//! nothing from its environment. What it *does* read is one file under
//! [`SPOOL_DIR`], which is root-owned `0700` and written only by the broker.
//! Its contents are therefore root's, and the gate still validates them, for two
//! reasons that both matter: the ownership check can only be trusted if it was
//! made on the **opened fd** rather than the path, and a gate that is correct
//! only when its input is well-formed is a gate whose correctness argument rests
//! on the thing an attacker attacks first.
//!
//! So the entry is validated as if hostile, and the properties established are
//! narrow and mechanical:
//!
//! 1. **It is this wire format.** An unknown schema, an unknown key, or a
//!    missing key is a hard parse failure, never a partially-understood request.
//! 2. **It is live.** Past its deadline, it is refused. Deadlines are in
//!    monotonic seconds, so moving the wall clock cannot extend one.
//! 3. **It is this caller's.** The entry names the pid *and* the start time of
//!    the `aido` process it was minted for. A pid alone is a name that can be
//!    reissued; `(pid, starttime)` identifies one process for as long as the
//!    kernel remembers it.
//! 4. **It belongs to the current policy generation.** An entry minted before
//!    the operator changed the rules is refused rather than honoured under the
//!    rules it was written against.
//!
//! Note what is deliberately *not* checked here: whether the action is
//! permitted. That is [`crate::decide()`]'s question, answered against root's
//! ruleset — never against the entry's own claim about it. Keeping the two apart
//! is what lets the gate state plainly that a forged entry can name any action
//! it likes and gain nothing the ruleset does not already grant.
