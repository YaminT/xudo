//! What the root lane must be true of itself before any root test can be
//! believed: a run that says it is uid 0 behaves like uid 0.
//!
//! `ci/root-test.sh` (`just root-test`) runs every `tests/root_*.rs` as real
//! root in a throwaway container, on a copy of the checkout. It exists for what
//! only root can observe: a file handed to `root:root` and moded `0440`, a
//! rename inside a directory only root may write. The rest of the workspace is
//! written for an unprivileged user and is not run there: it assumes the
//! opposite (a checkout that is not root's, a mode that refuses the caller), so
//! as root it fails, or passes for the wrong reason.
//!
//! These checks are the lane's tripwire. A lane that quietly ran as someone
//! else (a rootless container whose "root" cannot give a file away, a runner
//! that dropped the capability to override file modes) would turn every root
//! test written after them into a failure with no visible cause, or into a
//! refusal test that passes because the operation was refused for the wrong
//! reason. They fail first, and say what is missing.
//!
//! # Writing a root test
//!
//! * A file `tests/root_<name>.rs` in the crate that owns the code, with
//!   `#![cfg(feature = "root-tests")]`, and the feature declared in that crate's
//!   manifest. The lane selects `root_*` test targets by name and nothing else.
//!   A `[[test]]` entry with `required-features = ["root-tests"]` makes a build
//!   without the feature refuse to run the target instead of running it empty,
//!   as this file's entry does.
//! * Begin each test with `if !root_or_skip("<its name>") { return; }`, from
//!   `support/root_lane.rs`, which refuses (panics) as uid 0 without the
//!   sentinel file `ci/root-test.sh` makes in the container. Suites
//!   that enable every feature (`just test`, `just linux-test`, coverage) build
//!   this file and run it as an ordinary user, where it must neither fail nor
//!   pretend to have run. The lane reads the output and fails on any `SKIPPED:`
//!   line, so the only place a skip is accepted is the place nobody relies on.
//! * Assert what only root can show. A refusal that depends on a mode proves
//!   nothing here, because root is not refused by one.
//! * Scratch space under the target directory, never `/tmp`, and leave the
//!   container as the next test expects to find it: tests run one at a time.
