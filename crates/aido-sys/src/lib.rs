//! Platform abstraction for `aido`.
//!
//! `aido-policy` decides; this crate is the only place allowed to *look at the
//! machine*. Everything the system can tell us sits behind a trait with an
//! in-memory fake, so the logic on top is testable without Linux, without root,
//! and without a `/proc` at all.
//!
//! # What this crate is allowed to be trusted for
//!
//! Almost nothing, and that is deliberate.
//!
//! Everything read here — `comm`, `cmdline`, `environ`, the resolved `exe`, the
//! ancestry chain — is produced by the caller or by a process the caller
//! controls. So this crate's output is [`Hint`]s and an
//! [`Classification`], and at this milestone the classification is *always*
//! [`Classification::Unattested`]: there is no broker yet, no `SO_PEERPIDFD`,
//! and no cgroup scope to check against. Per the project's second invariant,
//! unattested routes to the human path with a password, so a machine with only
//! this crate installed can misclassify in exactly one direction — it can ask
//! for a password it did not strictly need, never skip one it did.
//!
//! That is why the `/proc` reader here does **not** carry the `openat2`
//! hardening that the M2 exec path will. A lie in a hint cannot escalate,
//! because a hint cannot authorize. The hardening belongs on the path that
//! opens and executes a file, and it arrives with that path.
//!
//! # Platform posture
//!
//! [`MacOsStub`] answers `Unsupported` to every privileged question and
//! `Unattested` to every classification, so a developer on macOS cannot
//! accidentally validate a Linux-only assumption: every decision path they
//! exercise is the fail-closed one.
//!
//! # `unsafe`
//!
//! None here, and the compiler holds that: this crate forbids `unsafe_code`
//! like every other. The five system calls that cannot be made without it
//! live in `aido-sys-raw`, behind a published block budget, and the rest of
//! the workspace reaches them only through [`Syscalls`], where a fake can stand
//! in for the kernel.
