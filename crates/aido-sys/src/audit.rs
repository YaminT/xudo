//! The audit trail: a privileged decision is written down before it takes
//! effect, or it does not take effect.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! [`AuditSink`] is what the broker and the gate write through, and its shape
//! carries the rule rather than a comment beside it:
//!
//! * [`AuditSink::append`] takes a function that builds the record **from the
//!   chain's last record**, called while the sink holds the log, so the record
//!   always follows what is really there. The sink checks that it does.
//! * It returns an [`AuditReceipt`], which only a sink in this crate can make,
//!   and only once every part of the trail holds the record and the log's data
//!   is on disk (`fdatasync`).
//! * [`authorize`] hands an approval back inside [`Authorized`] only with that
//!   receipt, and only for a record that describes the approval — the same
//!   command and the same governing action ([`Approval`]), checked before
//!   anything is written. When the record cannot be written, or describes
//!   something else, `authorize` returns the error and drops the approval it
//!   was given.
//! * That drop is not the guarantee: `aido_gate::Approved` is `Clone`, with
//!   public fields, so a caller can keep a copy. The guarantee is the other
//!   half — each privileged action, the broker minting a spool entry and the
//!   gate executing, is to take an `Authorized<_>`, which only `authorize`
//!   makes, so that acting on an approval nobody recorded does not compile.
//!   The gate's exec takes one (M2b step 4, `aido_gate::run`); the broker's
//!   mint is to (plan item D1, `docs/todo/m2b-finish-plan.md`: it writes its
//!   records to the journal on standard error until then).
//!
//! A refusal needs no receipt: it stands whether or not its record lands.
//! Write it with [`AuditSink::append`] anyway; a failure there changes nothing
//! about the answer, only what the caller can say about the trail.
//!
//! # How the broker and the gate call it
//!
//! The gate is wired (M2b step 4, `aido_gate::run`); the broker is not yet
//! (plan item D1). This is the shape both are expected to take, with the
//! record builders `aido-gate` already has:
//!
//! ```text
//! let mut trail = AuditTrail::system("aido-gate");          // "aidod" in the broker
//! match decide(&rules, &caller, pending.as_ref(), context) {
//!     Err(refusal) => {
//!         let _ = trail.append(&|prev| refusal_record(prev, &refusal, &caller, pending.as_ref()));
//!         exit(refusal.exit_code())
//!     }
//!     Ok(approved) => {
//!         let build = |prev: Option<&Record>, a: &Approved| authorization_record(prev, a, &caller, None);
//!         match authorize(&mut trail, approved, &build) {
//!             Ok(authorized) => execute(authorized),       // takes Authorized<Approved>
//!             Err(_unrecorded) => refuse_audit_unavailable(&mut trail),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The file is append-only, so an outcome learnt after the child exits is a new
//! record that names the one it completes, never an edit of it.
//!
//! # What the trail is made of
//!
//! [`AuditTrail`] writes the hash-chained log ([`JsonlLog`], the chain's
//! authority, at [`AUDIT_DIR`]`/`[`AUDIT_FILE_NAME`]) and then sends the record
//! to every mirror ([`JournaldSink`]) while it still holds the log's lock. An
//! append lands on the whole trail or on none of it: if the record does not
//! reach the disk, or a mirror refuses it, the log is cut back to where it
//! ended before the lock is released, so no other writer ever chains onto a
//! record nobody was given a receipt for. The receipt exists only if
//! everything took the record. A host without journald therefore records
//! nothing at all, refusals included, and refuses every decision that needs a
//! record.
