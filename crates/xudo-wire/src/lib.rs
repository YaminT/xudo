//! The broker's wire protocol: what the `xudo` front-end asks `xudod`, and
//! what `xudod` answers.
//!
//! Two programs speak it, on opposite sides of the privilege boundary. The
//! front-end runs as the caller and asks. The broker runs as root, learns who
//! asked from the kernel rather than from the request, decides, and — only on a
//! permitted decision — mints the spool entry the gate will act on.
//!
//! # Why a crate of its own
//!
//! If these types lived in `xudod`, the front-end would link the broker's spool
//! writer and peer identification just to build a request. If they lived in the
//! front-end, the root broker would link `clap` and a terminal renderer just to
//! parse one. Here they are pure data and their parsers, depending only on
//! `xudo-policy` for the decision envelope both sides already share. Nothing in
//! this crate opens a file, a socket, or a process.
//!
//! # One question, one answer
//!
//! The front-end connects to [`BROKER_SOCKET`], writes one [`BrokerRequest`] as
//! JSON, and shuts down its writing half. The broker reads to end of file —
//! never more than [`MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`] — writes one [`BrokerResponse`], and
//! closes. There is no second message, no session, and no negotiation: a
//! connection is one question.
//!
//! # What a request may say
//!
//! Only the question: the absolute program and its operands. Nothing in a
//! request identifies the caller, because the broker learns that from the
//! kernel; the one field that describes the caller,
//! [`BrokerRequest::claimed_classification`], is an unauthenticated hint the
//! broker records and never reads.
//!
//! Every message carries a schema version and rejects unknown keys, so a field
//! this build does not understand is a refusal, never a silently ignored line.
//!
//! # A refusal is a contract, not a story
//!
//! A refusal carries a [`RefusalCode`] — append-only, like the policy engine's
//! denial taxonomy — and a fixed remediation sentence. It carries no detail.
//! What went wrong on the broker's side, with the paths and the errno, goes to
//! the audit record that only root reads, not back to the process that asked.
