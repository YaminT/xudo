//! The five system calls `xudo` cannot make without `unsafe`, and the records
//! the kernel writes for two of them.
//!
//! This is the only crate in the workspace whose lint table does not forbid
//! `unsafe_code`. It denies it here, at the crate root, and allows it in one
//! module, [`sys`], whose blocks are counted against a budget published in that
//! module's docs. Everything above it — `xudo-sys`, which puts these calls
//! behind a trait with a fake, and every crate that uses that — forbids
//! `unsafe` outright, so the compiler keeps it here, not a reviewer.
//!
//! The data types live here rather than in `xudo-sys` because the kernel
//! writes [`PidfdInfo`] and [`PeerCred`] directly: their layout is part of the
//! unsafe contract, and it is checked against the kernel's structs beside the
//! calls that fill them.
//!
//! `tests/unsafe_budget.rs` holds the rest of the line: no `unsafe` token
//! anywhere else in the workspace, no lint attribute that lifts `unsafe_code`
//! anywhere but [`sys`], no crate but `xudo-sys` depending on this one, and no
//! drift between this crate's lint table and the workspace's.
