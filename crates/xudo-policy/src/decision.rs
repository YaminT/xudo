//! The verdict, its machine-readable envelope, and the denial taxonomy.
//!
//! # Why the taxonomy is append-only
//!
//! The primary consumer of `xudo` is a language model, and `exit 1` with a
//! prose message is the worst possible interface for one: the model guesses,
//! retries with a mangled command, or gives up and asks the human to run raw
//! `sudo` — defeating the tool. A stable code plus a concrete remediation lets
//! an agent branch correctly: needs a grant, so request one; permanently
//! denied, so stop asking; needs confirmation, so surface it and wait.
//!
//! Codes are therefore **append-only**. Renumbering one silently changes the
//! behaviour of every deployed agent that learned the old number.
