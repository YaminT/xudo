//! Rule files to a ruleset, the same way for every reader.
//!
//! Three programs read the root-owned ruleset: the front-end, to explain; the
//! broker, to mint a request; the gate, to decide again. They must agree, byte
//! for byte, on two things:
//!
//! * **Which files are rule files.** Two readers that selected differently
//!   would decide under different policies while claiming the same one.
//! * **Which generation of the policy those files are.** A spool entry carries
//!   the generation it was minted under and the gate refuses one minted under
//!   other rules, so two readers that hashed the same directory differently
//!   would make every request look stale, and two that hashed different
//!   directories alike would let a request outlive the rules it was minted
//!   under.
//!
//! Both answers live here, in the pure crate, and nowhere else. Reading the
//! bytes is the caller's job — by path in the front-end, through verified
//! descriptors in the privileged binaries — and this module never touches a
//! filesystem.
