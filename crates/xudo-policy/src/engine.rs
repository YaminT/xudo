//! Evaluation order, and the reasons for it.
//!
//! ```text
//! canonicalize argv
//!   -> frozen agent path               (agent, frozen   -> deny)
//!   -> look up the named action        (unknown action  -> deny)
//!   -> compare the program             (exe mismatch    -> deny)
//!   -> match the typed argument list   (argv rejected   -> deny)
//!   -> gather every action that accepts the same command
//!   -> agent-path eligibility          (any human-only  -> deny)
//!   -> COMPILED-IN DENY-LIST           (any class hit   -> deny)
//!   -> confirmation requirement        (the strictest   -> allow-with-confirmation)
//!   -> allow
//! ```
//!
//! [`evaluate_command`] is the same pipeline for a command that names no
//! action: it gathers every action that runs the program and accepts the
//! arguments, and decides over all of them.
//!
//! # Why the deny-list runs last
//!
//! Running it *after* allow matching is deliberate. If it ran first, a rule
//! author could believe their narrow rule had been checked when in fact the
//! deny-list had short-circuited on the executable and never examined the
//! arguments — and worse, a future refactor could reorder the two and silently
//! change which requests are refused. Running it last means the deny-list sees
//! exactly the canonicalized `(exe, argv)` tuple that would be executed, and
//! its verdict cannot be reached by any other path.
//!
//! It is also why *deny always wins*: there is no branch in which a matched
//! allow rule causes the deny-list to be skipped, and overlapping actions do
//! not change that — every action that accepts a command names the same
//! program and accepts the same arguments, so the deny-list sees one tuple
//! whichever of them the command was asked under.
//!
//! # Overlapping actions resolve to the strictest
//!
//! Two actions can accept the same command: a broad rule and a narrow one, or
//! one rule file repeating another. A requirement belongs to the command, not
//! to the name it was asked under. The caller chooses which action to name, so
//! a requirement that bound only the named action would let the caller pick
//! the weakest rule; and a search that stopped at the first permitting action
//! would let the sort order of two file names decide whether a human is asked.
//! So every action that accepts the command contributes:
//!
//! * if any of them is human-only, an enrolled agent is refused;
//! * the confirmation requirement is the strictest any of them demands, ranked
//!   by what it takes to lift: a critical tier, then a rule that always
//!   confirms, then the agent-path setting, then none.
//!
//! Adding a rule can grant a command that no rule accepted before; for a
//! command some rule already accepts, it can only make the answer stricter.
//! Reordering rules changes nothing but which of two equally strict actions a
//! decision cites. Both are standing properties in `tests/invariants.rs`.
//!
//! A permitted decision cites the action whose requirement it carries. Among
//! actions that tie, it cites the one that was asked for, or, when none was,
//! the first in declaration order.
//!
//! There is no last-match-wins and no negation: a negated rule is a way to
//! widen by reordering, which is what this resolution exists to rule out.
