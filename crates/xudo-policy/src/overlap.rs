//! Which actions can accept the same command.
//!
//! Overlapping actions are resolved safely: every action that accepts a command
//! contributes its requirement, and the strictest applies (see
//! [`crate::engine`]). An operator still needs to know where two rules
//! interact, because an overlap is two rules whose interaction nobody wrote
//! down, and it is how a rule meant as a narrow exception ends up governed by
//! the broad rule it was meant to refine. `xudo check` prints this report.
//!
//! # Silence means disjoint
//!
//! Two actions overlap when they name the same program, byte for byte, and
//! some argument list satisfies both argument lists. Each position is a typed
//! matcher, and whether two positions can hold the same argument is decided
//! exactly for most pairs of types and cannot be decided here for some — a
//! pattern against a pattern. Where it cannot be decided, and where the search
//! would be too large to finish, the pair is reported as a *possible* overlap
//! rather than passed over. A pair is left out of the report only when no
//! command can satisfy both.
//!
//! A *certain* overlap carries a witness: the operands of a command both
//! actions accept, checked against both with the engine's own matcher, in
//! canonical form, before it is reported.
//!
//! # How
//!
//! An argument list is a small automaton whose state is the position that
//! comes next and how many arguments that position has consumed. The two lists
//! are run in step over one shared argument list, consuming an argument only
//! where both current positions can hold the same one, and the question is
//! whether both can finish together. That is a breadth-first search over pairs
//! of states, so a witness is as short as the two lists allow.
