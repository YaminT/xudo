//! Pins every contract string a caller acts on: the denial-code wire contract
//! and every confirmation-prompt sentence.
//!
//! An agent branches on the code and a human decides on the sentence, so a
//! diff in either is a policy or UX change and must be reviewed as one. A
//! snapshot makes that diff impossible to land silently: `cargo test` fails
//! until the new text is accepted (`INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo test`, or
//! `cargo insta review`) and the changed `.snap` file reaches review.
//!
//! Writing the first snapshot here found a real defect: the `exe_mismatch`
//! remediation carried an eighteen-space run from a mis-wrapped string
//! literal, which every earlier test missed because each asserted only that a
//! substring was present.
