//! so descriptor 0 is borrowed from `std::io::stdin()` — no `LISTEN_FDS` to
//! read from an environment a privileged process must not trust, and no
//! descriptor adopted by number. Everything else is the `xudod` library,
//! covered by its own tests; `tests/broker.rs` runs this binary as a process.
