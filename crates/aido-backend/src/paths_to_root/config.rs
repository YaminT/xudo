//! sudoers and doas configuration, read for the one thing that matters here:
//! a rule that runs as root without a password.
//!
//! **Not a parser.** sudo's grammar has aliases, negation, digests, and
//! escapes, and getting any of it subtly wrong in a parser would produce a
//! confident wrong answer. This reads lines and looks for tokens, and every
//! choice it makes errs towards reporting:
//!
//! * A line is a whole-line comment only when its first non-blank byte is `#`
//!   and it is not an include directive or a `#<uid>` user. A `#` later in a
//!   line does not hide a tag on it: the whole line is read.
//! * **A line that ends in a backslash is never modelled.** sudo (`toke.l`)
//!   and `OpenDoas` (`yylex`) each decide whether a trailing backslash joins
//!   the next line by what precedes it (an escape, a comment, a quote, a token
//!   under way, a carriage return), and four rounds of review each found
//!   another case where this module and the real lexer disagreed (verified
//!   against sudo 1.9.16p2 and `OpenDoas` 6.8.2). So the decision, recorded in
//!   `docs/CONCERNS.md`, is to stop modelling continuations: every physical
//!   line whose last byte, past trailing whitespace, is a backslash (whatever
//!   precedes it, in either dialect, a whole-line comment included) makes what
//!   it may join **unmodelled**. Every rule on that logical line, and on the
//!   line after a comment that ends in a backslash, is `Scope::Unknown`
//!   (reported "maybe", never "no"); a `NOPASSWD`, `!authenticate` or `nopass`
//!   anywhere in the joined text counts, whatever kind of statement the line
//!   was taken for and even where a word is split across the join (`OpenDoas`
//!   reads `permit nopass 10\` then `00` as uid 1000, and `:2\` then `7` as
//!   gid 27); and the file is listed as unverified, so its check is never
//!   clean: found where a rule is found, unverified where none is.
//! * **An include on a line aido does not model is reported as an include,
//!   whatever else is found.** An include path is the one token sudo reads
//!   with a final backslash in it: `@include /p\` opens the file named `p\`
//!   (and the line after it is a rule of its own), while `@include /p \` ends
//!   the path at the blank, and the backslash continues. So each physical line
//!   of a joined line is read twice, with its trailing backslash cut off and as
//!   written (`/p` and `/p\`; for `/p\ `, a backslash and a blank, which is
//!   an escaped blank in the name, `/p` and `/p `), for `@include`, `#include`,
//!   `@includedir` and `#includedir`, on the first line or a later one (sudo
//!   honours an include on the line after `lecture_file=/etc/x\ `, which it
//!   does not join); a path that is not there is reported as unverified.
//!
//!   **Those paths are hints, not necessarily the file sudo opens**, and two
//!   shapes show it: a backslash-newline *inside the quotes* of an include path
//!   is dropped and the path goes on (`@include "/etc/s4/a\` then `b"` opens
//!   `/etc/s4/ab`, `toke.l` line 786 and the `<GOTINC>` state), and an include
//!   path may *start on the continuation line* of its directive (`@include\`
//!   then `/etc/s6/a\`, `toke.l` lines 173 and 858). Every further shape is
//!   another round of review, and this module has stopped chasing them. The
//!   guarantee is a containment instead: **a line that is not settled and holds
//!   the word `include`, in a physical line or across a join, is a finding of
//!   its own** (`Grant::Include`, scope unknown, so "maybe", and `"grant":
//!   "include"` on the wire), on the physical line that holds the word. The
//!   report can then never show only "names others" while an include it could
//!   not read stands, and the check is never clean. A settled include on a
//!   modelled line adds nothing. `OpenDoas` has no include directive, so
//!   nothing changes for doas.
//!
//!   Adversarial tests, each with an end-to-end twin in `tests.rs`:
//!   `denies_any_line_ending_in_a_backslash_hiding_the_callers_nopasswd_rule`
//!   (twin: `..._passwordless_rule`, a property over every generated head and
//!   every spelling of a rule that names the caller),
//!   `denies_a_trailing_backslash_in_an_include_path_absorbing_the_callers_rule`,
//!   `denies_an_include_path_keeping_its_backslash_hiding_the_file_sudo_opens`
//!   (twin: `denies_an_include_path_ending_in_a_backslash_crediting_the_callers_grant_to_the_plain_named_file`),
//!   `denies_an_include_on_a_later_line_keeping_its_backslash_hiding_the_file_sudo_opens`
//!   (with a CRLF twin),
//!   `denies_an_include_continued_inside_its_quotes_hiding_the_file_sudo_opens`,
//!   `denies_an_include_path_starting_on_a_continuation_line_hiding_the_file_sudo_opens`,
//!   `denies_an_include_directive_split_across_a_join_hiding_its_file`
//!   (twin: `denies_an_include_sudo_reads_from_a_file_aido_did_not_open_hiding_the_callers_grant`
//!   and a property over every generated head),
//!   `denies_an_include_on_a_line_the_program_did_not_join_hiding_the_callers_grant`
//!   and `denies_a_continuation_splitting_a_doas_identity_as_another_users`.
//!   This is a containment, not a fix: reading the program's own answer for the
//!   caller (`doas -C <file> <cmd>`, `sudo -l -U <user>`) is plan item D3
//!   (`docs/todo/m2b-finish-plan.md`), and replaces this reader, and the
//!   include finding, where it can run.
//! * Within one physical line the scan is left to right with escape semantics,
//!   for tag and comment detection (see `read_line`): a `#` ends the part of
//!   the line that counts as text for a comment, except in sudo a `#<digit>`
//!   or `#-<digit>` id, and `OpenDoas` has no such exception.
//! * **Exactly these escapes are modelled**: a backslash before a backslash
//!   (`\\` is one literal backslash), before a `#` (not a comment), and before
//!   a blank (an escaped blank). **Everything else is unmodelled**: a
//!   backslash before any other byte (`\q`, `\xHH`, `\"`, `\r`), and a double
//!   quote on a line that also has a backslash or a `#` past its first byte.
//!   Such a line makes the file unverified, and every rule on a logical line it
//!   is part of is reported as naming someone aido cannot resolve ("maybe"),
//!   not as another user's. `OpenDoas` drops the backslash of an escape, so
//!   `nopas\s` is the keyword `nopass` to it (and grants); a doas line with an
//!   unmodelled escape is therefore searched for `nopass` as written and with
//!   its backslashes removed
//!   (`denies_a_doas_keyword_spelled_with_an_escape_hiding_the_callers_rule`).
//!   The adversarial tests are
//!   `an_unmodelled_construct_makes_what_it_could_join_unknown_never_clean`
//!   and, end to end,
//!   `an_unmodelled_construct_cannot_make_the_passwordless_check_clean`.
//!   Nothing beyond this is claimed about which lines sudo or `OpenDoas` joins.
//! * `NOPASSWD`, `!authenticate`, and `nopass` are found as whole words
//!   anywhere in a live line, whatever surrounds them. `!authenticate` is
//!   looked for on every line, not only on `Defaults`; off a `Defaults` line
//!   it names nobody it can read, which is reported as "maybe".
//!
//! Bytes throughout: a configuration file is not guaranteed to be UTF-8, and a
//! lossy conversion here could split a token in two.
